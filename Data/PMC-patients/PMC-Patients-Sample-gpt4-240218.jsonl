Pertinent history was a normal growth and development until puberty with a very active lifestyle. No family history of HS, colitis, or other autoimmune disease was present; however, both maternal grandparents had late-onset diabetes. At the age of 11 years, she immigrated to the United States with her mother and 2 months later begun menstruation. Within 4 months, she had a 45-pound weight gain. One month later, she developed fever and perianal pain, and underwent surgery for a large perianal abscess. She developed multiple skin lesions consistent with HS. Acne was seen to develop over the face, and periods became irregular. Over the next 6 months, her disease became widespread with up to 20 lesions present at any one time and intermittent perianal disease. Widespread abdominal scarring resulted in contracture of the entire body. She underwent extensive therapy over a total of 8 years with multiple episodic and continuous regimens of oral and intravenous antibiotics, numerous surgeries, isotretinoin for acne treatment, periodic metformin, and oral birth control usage, all without improvement of her disease.\nMenstrual periods caused severe flare-ups that required increased pain medication. Sleep was severely impaired.\nPhysical examination confirmed HS encompassing most of the truncal area anteriorly from the inframammary area to the groin, extending to the right axilla, incorporating nearly 40% of her body surface, with extensive muscle wasting of the extremities. Facial acne without scarring was present. Hirsutism was notably absent. Her weight was 215 pounds, with a BMI of 37, placing her at class II obesity. Laboratory results are detailed in Table and were notable for profound microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 6.2 g/dL with normal iron indices, and were considered as an anemia of chronic disease along with elevated liver enzymes that were presumed to be due to fatty liver. Her blood sugar was 117 mg/dL on average due to HbA1c of 5.7% and qualifies for pre-diabetes.\nTo offset the weight gain, an aggressive lifestyle modification program was initialed that focused on a low-carbohydrate diet primarily, since physical activity was too painful. Oral contraception was restarted to decrease the flares with menstruation. She was placed on dapsone 100 mg/day, after a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test was reported as negative. Initial minimal improvements were noted. A few months later, finasteride 5 mg/day and metformin 2,000 mg/day, followed by liraglutide 0.6 mg subcutaneously daily, increased to 1.8 mg over 2 months, were administered. She lost approximately 40 pounds (19% body weight) in a 6-month period with her lowest weight recorded at that time, with a trend of regain subsequently. Monthly follow-ups were undertaken with complete laboratory testing at each visit. The liver enzymes responded first with declines within 6 months, and resolution within a year. Leukocytosis, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia returned more gradually to normalcy at 2 years of treatment. The sedimentation rate, though greatly reduced form over 120 to 34 mm/h, is still above normal, and total proteins remain slightly above normal. HbA1c was 5.2% after 2 years and 4.9% after 3 years with average estimated blood sugar of 94 mg/d; though weight was regained (Fig. ). Blood testing was reduced to every 3 months after 2 years of the regimen since the improvements were stable and maintained.\nThe clinical course did not respond initially as well as the laboratory findings, with no improvement in the first 3 months. Then, new lesions did appear but resolved faster. The patient began to feel better and did have less intense and frequent flares about 6 months into the regimen. Nine months later, another large perianal abscess developed that required hospitalization and surgery. The perianal lesion healed completely in 3 weeks, as compared to a similar instance 3 years prior, which needed 6 months of dressings and care. The patient elected to avoid any extensive debridement. In the past year, she has not required adjunctive antibiotics, and risk of pregnancy, though addressed, has not been a concern.\nAt present, she has not had a new lesion for 6 months and has completed 3 years of the regimen, with remarkable tolerance. Axillary lesions have healed completely, groin, thigh, and perianal disease have improved 90% or more, while thoraco-abdominal lesions have improved 60% with 4–5 small areas persisting. Facial acne has improved but persisted. During the frequent follow-up visits, adverse effects were asked for routinely and weight regain was noted. No physical or biochemical abnormality was detected, and only the sedimentation rate is minimally elevated.

The pain aggravated on walking. There was no history of trauma and was not associated with fever, loss of weight, or any other constitutional symptoms. History and family history were non-contributory. Clinical examination revealed no inspectory findings. Palpation revealed tenderness over the anterior aspect of the distal tibia with no local rise of temperature. Range of motion of the right ankle joint was painful and restricted. X-rays revealed a well-defined expansile predominantly lytic lesion in the distal epi-metaphyseal region of the right tibia with minimal periosteal reaction seen along the medial margin suggestive of malignant tumor of the bone (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right ankle joint suggested an ill-defined eccentric expansile lesion measuring 4.3 (CC) × 3.0 (transverse) × 2.9 (anteroposterior) involving epi-metaphyseal end of the lower end of tibia causing cortical breach and having extra-osseous tissue component with the abnormal signal in flexor and extensor group of muscles with the possibility of GCT (). According to the radiological classification of campanacci the tumor was classified as a grade 3 lesions []. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits and surgery in the form of intralesional curettage with bone cement was planned. Anterior incision was taken over the distal end of the tibia. Bone was exposed, a cortical window of 3 cm × 2 cm was made (), the tumor was excised (), and curettage was done. The specimen was sent to histopathology for further examination. A thorough wash was given, and the defect was treated with 5% phenol. The cavity was filled with three layers consisting of bone graft, gel foam, and cement mixed with vancomycin, respectively ().

History and family history were non-contributory. Clinical examination revealed no inspectory findings. Palpation revealed tenderness over the anterior aspect of the distal tibia with no local rise of temperature. Range of motion of the right ankle joint was painful and restricted. X-rays revealed a well-defined expansile predominantly lytic lesion in the distal epi-metaphyseal region of the right tibia with minimal periosteal reaction seen along the medial margin suggestive of malignant tumor of the bone (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right ankle joint suggested an ill-defined eccentric expansile lesion measuring 4.3 (CC) × 3.0 (transverse) × 2.9 (anteroposterior) involving epi-metaphyseal end of the lower end of tibia causing cortical breach and having extra-osseous tissue component with the abnormal signal in flexor and extensor group of muscles with the possibility of GCT (). According to the radiological classification of campanacci the tumor was classified as a grade 3 lesions []. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits and surgery in the form of intralesional curettage with bone cement was planned. Anterior incision was taken over the distal end of the tibia. Bone was exposed, a cortical window of 3 cm × 2 cm was made (), the tumor was excised (), and curettage was done. The specimen was sent to histopathology for further examination. A thorough wash was given, and the defect was treated with 5% phenol. The cavity was filled with three layers consisting of bone graft, gel foam, and cement mixed with vancomycin, respectively (). The tumor was sent for histopathological examination which confirmed the diagnosis of GCT ().

The shortness of breath was insidious in onset and followed a progressive course. Besides, she reported orthopnea, primarily upon lying on her right side (trepopnea). The patient denied; cough, chest pain, wheezes, or fever. There was no history of joint pain, skin rash, photosensitivity, or other symptoms suggestive of connective tissue disease. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker. She is a housewife with no relevant occupational exposure.\nOn examination, she was distressed and tachypneic. Her oxygen saturation measured 91%, and the trachea was deviated to the right. No Jugular venous distension was present. The chest examination was consistent with left-sided PE, and the abdominal exam showed splenomegaly. She had palpable bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. There was no lower limb edema. No rash was noticed over the chins.\nInitial laboratory evaluation revealed mild normocytic anemia with no other abnormalities on cell counts. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated. Chemistry showed a normal kidney and liver functions. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 22.2 mg/L (0–5 mg/L), and procalcitonin was not elevated. The serum angiotensin converting enzyme level was raised. Chest X-ray revealed complete white-out of the left hemothorax suggestive of massive PE; additionally, a contralateral mediastinal shift (Fig. ). Therapeutic and diagnostic pleural tapping was performed. The pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative effusion with lymphocyte predominance (Table ). Adenosine deaminase was 2.0 U/L. Connective tissue disease (CTD) screening panel, including antinuclear antibody, antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti citrullinated c peptides were negative.\nTwo cytological evaluation and flow cytometry of the pleural fluid showed no evidence of malignant cells. Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated multiple thoracic, abdominal, and inguinal lymph nodes along with left-sided PE. The spleen was enlarged with variable size hypodense lesions (Fig. ). CT guided core biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node showed the pathological findings of non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Positron emission tomography-CT was requested and showed intense fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the spleen and the lymph nodes with no other areas of uptake (Fig. ). The initial histopathological evaluation showed evidence of non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation suggestive of sarcoidosis; however, the presence of massive PE pushed towards the need to rule out other possibilities mainly; tuberculosis (TB) and malignancy. Left side medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) was performed that showed erythematous inflammation of the parietal pleura. Histopathology report showed only non-specific inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. All microbiological tests were negative.\nIn light of the mentioned findings, we labeled the patient as sarcoidosis. She was started on prednisolone 40 mg daily and was discharged home for regular follow up in the outpatient clinic.

The shortness of breath was insidious in onset and followed a progressive course. Besides, she reported orthopnea, primarily upon lying on her right side (trepopnea). The patient denied; cough, chest pain, wheezes, or fever. There was no history of joint pain, skin rash, photosensitivity, or other symptoms suggestive of connective tissue disease. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker. She is a housewife with no relevant occupational exposure.\nOn examination, she was distressed and tachypneic. Her oxygen saturation measured 91%, and the trachea was deviated to the right. No Jugular venous distension was present. The chest examination was consistent with left-sided PE, and the abdominal exam showed splenomegaly. She had palpable bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. There was no lower limb edema. No rash was noticed over the chins.\nInitial laboratory evaluation revealed mild normocytic anemia with no other abnormalities on cell counts. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated. Chemistry showed a normal kidney and liver functions. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 22.2 mg/L (0–5 mg/L), and procalcitonin was not elevated. The serum angiotensin converting enzyme level was raised. Chest X-ray revealed complete white-out of the left hemothorax suggestive of massive PE; additionally, a contralateral mediastinal shift (Fig. ). Therapeutic and diagnostic pleural tapping was performed. The pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative effusion with lymphocyte predominance (Table ). Adenosine deaminase was 2.0 U/L. Connective tissue disease (CTD) screening panel, including antinuclear antibody, antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti citrullinated c peptides were negative.\nTwo cytological evaluation and flow cytometry of the pleural fluid showed no evidence of malignant cells. Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated multiple thoracic, abdominal, and inguinal lymph nodes along with left-sided PE. The spleen was enlarged with variable size hypodense lesions (Fig. ). CT guided core biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node showed the pathological findings of non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Positron emission tomography-CT was requested and showed intense fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the spleen and the lymph nodes with no other areas of uptake (Fig. ). The initial histopathological evaluation showed evidence of non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation suggestive of sarcoidosis; however, the presence of massive PE pushed towards the need to rule out other possibilities mainly; tuberculosis (TB) and malignancy. Left side medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) was performed that showed erythematous inflammation of the parietal pleura. Histopathology report showed only non-specific inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. All microbiological tests were negative.\nIn light of the mentioned findings, we labeled the patient as sarcoidosis. She was started on prednisolone 40 mg daily and was discharged home for regular follow up in the outpatient clinic. Over the next 3 weeks, the patient had a rapid recurrence of the effusion, necessitating the need for therapeutic drainage twice. Because of recurrent rapid re-accumulation and failure of medical treatment, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgeon, and surgical pleurodesis was performed without complications.\nLater evaluation with pulmonary function tests revealed a normal lung function and a 6-minute walk test.

A brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed severe hydrocephalus without intracerebral hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. Five days after admission, a VP shunt was implanted. Fifteen days later, the patient had a temperature over 38℃ and a chest X-ray showed patchy consolidation with partial collapse in the right lung. A sputum culture isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures were negative.\nThe patient received an initial regimen of intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and fluconazole), which was shifted to ciprofloxane due to a sustained high fever until the fever subsided. However, the patient became febrile again 6 days later. Liver function tests yielded an alanine aminotransferase level of 115 U/L and an alkaline phosphatase level of 702 IU/L. Fortunately, a chest X-ray showed gradual improvement of the right lung compared to the previous study. At that time, an ultrasonography of the liver revealed two 6-cm-sized hypoechoic masses. A subsequent abdominal CT showed multiple irregular-walled and diverse-sized cysts, including two large ones, which were not enhanced (). The long segment of the distal shunt tube was found going through the subcapsular portion of the right hepatic lobe and the tip of the tube was embedded in the lower large cyst (). Ultrasonography-guided needle aspiration of the upper lesion and percutaneous catheter drainage of the lower lesion resulted in continuous gushing of yellowish pus.

Fifteen days later, the patient had a temperature over 38℃ and a chest X-ray showed patchy consolidation with partial collapse in the right lung. A sputum culture isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures were negative.\nThe patient received an initial regimen of intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and fluconazole), which was shifted to ciprofloxane due to a sustained high fever until the fever subsided. However, the patient became febrile again 6 days later. Liver function tests yielded an alanine aminotransferase level of 115 U/L and an alkaline phosphatase level of 702 IU/L. Fortunately, a chest X-ray showed gradual improvement of the right lung compared to the previous study. At that time, an ultrasonography of the liver revealed two 6-cm-sized hypoechoic masses. A subsequent abdominal CT showed multiple irregular-walled and diverse-sized cysts, including two large ones, which were not enhanced (). The long segment of the distal shunt tube was found going through the subcapsular portion of the right hepatic lobe and the tip of the tube was embedded in the lower large cyst (). Ultrasonography-guided needle aspiration of the upper lesion and percutaneous catheter drainage of the lower lesion resulted in continuous gushing of yellowish pus.

At the time of presentation, she was noted to have acute onset of mild-range elevated blood pressures (140s-150s/90s) with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.37, consistent with a diagnosis of preeclampsia. Six hours after admission, her blood pressures progressed to severe-range, with a maximum of 195/105. Per protocol, she was given IV labetalol and MgSO4 for preeclampsia with severe features. Shortly thereafter, the patient retrospectively reported that she began to have mid-back pain along with numbness, tingling, and weakness in her right lower extremity, but she did not report these symptoms initially to her healthcare team, as she was more concerned about her pelvic pain with contractions. Approximately 3 hours after the onset of her neurological symptoms, a labor epidural was administered to help control her contraction pain and blood pressures. The epidural catheter was placed uneventfully at L3-L4 with the tip threaded to the maximum height of T11. As the epidural was being placed, the patient then reported to the anesthesiologist that she had been feeling weak. The patient was noted to appear lethargic on exam, but she was able to sit up with minimal assistance for her labor epidural. Therefore, her weakness was attributed to labor. She progressed to complete cervical dilation and had a vaginal delivery with vacuum assistance due to a 5-minute prolonged deceleration on FHT.\nThe patient continued to complain of leg weakness after delivery. At 14 hours postpartum, the nurse encouraged the patient to attempt ambulation. However, even with her best efforts, the patient was unable to move her body from a distinct line below her breasts down to her toes. She also noticed numbness, burning, and electrical sensations to light touch from that line down to her toes. At this time the resident team was notified, and a Foley catheter was inserted. There was low suspicion for magnesium toxicity as she had intact reflexes with no complaints of shortness of breath, and her magnesium level was 5.9. She still had mild-range elevated blood pressures at the time, and she remained on IV magnesium for 24 hours postpartum.\nA stat CT scan of the head without contrast resulted in normal findings with no evidence of stroke. MRI of the spine showed a fluid sac suggestive of epidural blood, measuring 3.5 cm in the craniocaudal plane and 0.4 cm in the anteroposterior plane. There was also a mild-to-moderate degree of spinal stenosis at T5-T6 due to extrinsic mass effect of the epidural hemorrhage but no direct spinal cord compression (Figures and ). The patient was immediately started on IV dexamethasone 4 mg q6h. Upon evaluation by neurosurgery, the patient was not considered to be a surgical candidate because the MRI showed no clear evidence of spinal cord hemorrhage or spinal cord compression.\nOn the morning of postpartum day #1, the patient remained with paresthesia in her lower extremities and flaccid paralysis from the waist down, but she was able to wiggle her toes. Her blood pressures were predominately normal (120-140/80-90) with a few mild-range elevated blood pressures. Per protocol, she was kept on IV magnesium for seizure prophylaxis until she was 24 hours postpartum. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the spine later that day showed an epidural lesion with a hemosiderin ring that had decreased in size to 2-3 mm in maximal depth, suggestive of a resolving epidural hematoma when compared to the most recent MRI ().\nOn postpartum day #2, the patient was started on PO nifedipine XL 30 mg daily to consistently maintain her blood pressures within normal range. Her mobility improved with demonstrated flexion and extension at the hips bilaterally, in addition to return of normal sensation in her lower extremities.\nThe patient's movements and sensation continued to improve day by day while she was kept on IV dexamethasone and PO nifedipine. By postpartum day #4, the patient was ambulating with a walker and had good bladder and bowel control. On postpartum day #6, the patient was ambulating without assistance and reported complete resolution of her pain in the back and lower extremities. She was discharged home in stable condition.\nA follow-up MRI 6 weeks later showed complete resolution of the spinal epidural hematoma ().

Shortly thereafter, the patient retrospectively reported that she began to have mid-back pain along with numbness, tingling, and weakness in her right lower extremity, but she did not report these symptoms initially to her healthcare team, as she was more concerned about her pelvic pain with contractions. Approximately 3 hours after the onset of her neurological symptoms, a labor epidural was administered to help control her contraction pain and blood pressures. The epidural catheter was placed uneventfully at L3-L4 with the tip threaded to the maximum height of T11. As the epidural was being placed, the patient then reported to the anesthesiologist that she had been feeling weak. The patient was noted to appear lethargic on exam, but she was able to sit up with minimal assistance for her labor epidural. Therefore, her weakness was attributed to labor. She progressed to complete cervical dilation and had a vaginal delivery with vacuum assistance due to a 5-minute prolonged deceleration on FHT.\nThe patient continued to complain of leg weakness after delivery. At 14 hours postpartum, the nurse encouraged the patient to attempt ambulation. However, even with her best efforts, the patient was unable to move her body from a distinct line below her breasts down to her toes. She also noticed numbness, burning, and electrical sensations to light touch from that line down to her toes. At this time the resident team was notified, and a Foley catheter was inserted. There was low suspicion for magnesium toxicity as she had intact reflexes with no complaints of shortness of breath, and her magnesium level was 5.9. She still had mild-range elevated blood pressures at the time, and she remained on IV magnesium for 24 hours postpartum.\nA stat CT scan of the head without contrast resulted in normal findings with no evidence of stroke. MRI of the spine showed a fluid sac suggestive of epidural blood, measuring 3.5 cm in the craniocaudal plane and 0.4 cm in the anteroposterior plane. There was also a mild-to-moderate degree of spinal stenosis at T5-T6 due to extrinsic mass effect of the epidural hemorrhage but no direct spinal cord compression (Figures and ). The patient was immediately started on IV dexamethasone 4 mg q6h. Upon evaluation by neurosurgery, the patient was not considered to be a surgical candidate because the MRI showed no clear evidence of spinal cord hemorrhage or spinal cord compression.\nOn the morning of postpartum day #1, the patient remained with paresthesia in her lower extremities and flaccid paralysis from the waist down, but she was able to wiggle her toes. Her blood pressures were predominately normal (120-140/80-90) with a few mild-range elevated blood pressures. Per protocol, she was kept on IV magnesium for seizure prophylaxis until she was 24 hours postpartum. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the spine later that day showed an epidural lesion with a hemosiderin ring that had decreased in size to 2-3 mm in maximal depth, suggestive of a resolving epidural hematoma when compared to the most recent MRI ().\nOn postpartum day #2, the patient was started on PO nifedipine XL 30 mg daily to consistently maintain her blood pressures within normal range. Her mobility improved with demonstrated flexion and extension at the hips bilaterally, in addition to return of normal sensation in her lower extremities.\nThe patient's movements and sensation continued to improve day by day while she was kept on IV dexamethasone and PO nifedipine. By postpartum day #4, the patient was ambulating with a walker and had good bladder and bowel control. On postpartum day #6, the patient was ambulating without assistance and reported complete resolution of her pain in the back and lower extremities. She was discharged home in stable condition.\nA follow-up MRI 6 weeks later showed complete resolution of the spinal epidural hematoma (). At the time, she was still ambulating independently and had full control of her bladder and bowel function.''' \n\n output:", "gpt_gene": "```json\n{\n  \"originalText\": \"MRI of the spine showed a fluid sac suggestive of epidural blood, measuring 3.5 cm in the craniocaudal plane and 0.4 cm in the anteroposterior plane.

He reported an unintentional 10-pound weight loss during this period and multiple clay-colored, soft bowel movements that worsened two weeks prior to presentation. At the outside hospital, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen were done, which the patient endorsed, showed only a “thickened gallbladder.” He was discharged on ursodiol and diphenhydramine, which he was compliant with. However, he noticed worsening of his pruritic rash, which started as small, round lesions on his elbows that spread to his back and abdomen, at which time he was told by his gastroenterologist to discontinue the ursodiol. The rash continued to worsen, spreading over his entire body, which prompted his return to the hospital.\nUpon admission, the patient was alert and oriented, afebrile, tachycardic to 115 beats per minute, and mildly hypotensive (94/66). The exam was notable for bilateral lower extremity edema, jaundice, multiple enlarged, non-tender inguinal and cervical LAD, hepatosplenomegaly, and diffuse, non-blanching, flat, erythematous, morbilliform rash (Figure ). He denied chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, weakness, dysuria, or hematuria. He also denied any recent travel, sick contacts, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use, alcohol use, drug use, risky sexual behavior, blood transfusions, or new medications aside from the discontinued ursodiol.\nLab work was significant for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1572 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1392 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 148 IU/L, total bilirubin 14.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 9.9 mg/dL, protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 1.9, sodium 129 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, white blood cell (WBC) 6.5 with 25% eosinophils, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.8. Imaging of the abdomen showed gastrohepatic ligament and porta-hepatic lymphadenopathy (LAD), enlarged spleen, and a heterogeneously enlarged liver (Figure ).

Viral studies, lymphoma panel, and other chronic liver disease autoantibodies were negative. His ceruloplasmin was normal and his ferritin level was only mildly elevated at 300 ng/mL.\nA trans-jugular liver biopsy showed severe cholestasis and acute hepatitis with a marked mixed portal and lobular inflammatory infiltrate comprised of numerous eosinophils and plasma cells, as well as pericellular, periportal, and sinusoidal fibrosis with focal bridging (Figure ). The patient was started on intravenous (IV) steroids for presumed AIH versus drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. The patient also had an inguinal lymph node excisional biopsy, which showed histiocyte proliferation with nuclear grooves that were positive for S-100, CD-1a, fascin, langerin, CD-45, and CD-68, consistent with LCH (Figure , Figure , Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and a bone scan were done to workup LCH, both of which were negative for additional pulmonary or bone lesions. On further molecular testing, no BRAF V600E mutation, no IGH rearrangement, and no TCR rearrangement were detected.\nAfter initiating glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone), the patient's liver enzymes began to improve, and his rash resolved. However, despite high-dose IV steroids, the patient’s mental status began to deteriorate. CT of the head was negative for any acute intracranial process, and he was noted to have elevated ammonia (112 µmol/L). He was started on lactulose enemas for presumed hepatic encephalopathy with a resolution of his symptoms. Three days later, the patient began to have several, large bloody bowel movements requiring the initiation of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP). He became hemodynamically unstable secondary to hemorrhagic shock, necessitating intubation and four vasopressive agents to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg. Abdominal angiography isolated the hemorrhage to the distal branch of the right ileocolic artery requiring emergent embolization by interventional radiology (IR), which was initially successful. However, three days after embolization, the patient had progressively worsening bloody bowel movements, again requiring MTP. Interventional radiology was unable to localize the source of bleeding on a repeat abdominal angiogram, necessitating an emergent right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis to control the bleed. Unfortunately, four days after his surgery, the patient experienced severe abdominal pain with an abdominal X-ray showing pneumo-peritoneum.

The mother had a history of a negative screening test 6 months before delivery and no treatment for syphilis. Apgar scores were 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Physical examination revealed a desquamative rash on the hands and feet, distended abdomen, palpable hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. Laboratory data demonstrated hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dl, hematocrit 32.7%, and reticulocyte 7.86%), leukocytosis (white blood cells [WBC] 17,630/μl), elevated C-reactive protein (9.39 mg/dl), and hypoglycemia (30 mg/dl). Rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests on the neonate and mother were all reactive. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis disclosed a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer at 1:32, a WBC of 7/μl, and a protein level of 230 mg/dl. Diffuse osteochondritis was identified on long-bone radiographs. A course of intravenous aqueous penicillin G (50,000 units/kg/dose, every 12 hours for 1 week and thereafter every 8 hours for a total of 3 weeks) was established. Because of poor respiratory effort with undersized lungs at birth, the infant was mechanically ventilated for 17 days, with transient episodes of respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonitis.\nPersistent bleeding from venipuncture sites and hemorrhagic endotracheal aspirates were noted on postnatal day 1. DIC was identified on the hematological profile (platelet count, 20,000/μl; prothrombin time, 16.5 vs control, 10.1 to 12.6 seconds with the international normalized ratio of 1.46 vs 0.93–1.13; partial thromboplastin time, 69.3 vs 23.6 to 31.1 seconds; antithrombin III, 14%; fibrinogen, 136 mg/dl; and D-dimer, 16511.3 ng/ml DDU). Serial cranial ultrasound revealed both intraventricular hemorrhage, up to grade 2. Blood component therapy comprising fresh frozen plasma, antithrombin III, and platelet concentrates corrected the hematological indices of coagulopathy and the bleeding diathesis.\nInitial liver function tests revealed an elevated total bilirubin (6.3 mg/dl) with the direct fraction of 73% (4.6 mg/dl) and raised serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (355 and 97 IU/L, respectively) (Table ). After the initiation of penicillin therapy, the direct hyperbilirubinemia was progressive until postnatal day 4, reflecting the hemolysis at birth along with initial high AST levels (Table ). Serum ALT and AST levels were elevated in response to daily administered penicillin dosage (Table ). After a complete course of parenteral penicillin, serum bilirubin, ALT and AST reduced to the initial high levels (in AST, the level on day 3), which gradually improved thereafter but direct hyperbilirubinemia persisted (Table ). Cholescintigraphy (DISIDA scan) on day 67 depicted biliary-to-bowel transit on delayed 6-hour images.\nOn postnatal day 3, small bowel obstruction was suspected because serial abdominal radiographs showed progressive gastric dilatation with a centrally located small bowel gas and no colon gas. The infant spontaneously passed an average amount of meconium defecating ten times for the first 2 days. Total parenteral nutrition was instituted. Gastrografin enemas were performed every 24 hours for 5 days (on days 3–9 except days 5 and 6 of patent ductus arteriosus ligation and the first postoperative day) and produced small amounts of stool. Serial contrast enemas consistently demonstrated a microcolon with multiple intraluminal filling defects (meconium plugs) and no possible reflux into the distal ileum, with progressively worsening gastric and proximal bowel loops dilation (Fig. ). On day 9, at laparotomy two-thirds of the small bowel was plugged by inspissated meconium, which was not milked distally and located in the bowel segment 80 cm long (from the jejunum 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz to the ileum 50 cm from the ileocecal valve). After proximal ileotomy at 70 cm distance from the ileocecal valve and warm saline irrigation, most of the dark green and jelly-like sticky meconium was evacuated and distal loop ileostomy was performed.\nSerological assays for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Testing for thyroid functions and alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, genetic analysis for cystic fibrosis, and submucosal rectal biopsies were all within normal range.\nPostoperative follow-up was uneventful.

The mother had a history of a negative screening test 6 months before delivery and no treatment for syphilis. Apgar scores were 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Physical examination revealed a desquamative rash on the hands and feet, distended abdomen, palpable hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. Laboratory data demonstrated hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dl, hematocrit 32.7%, and reticulocyte 7.86%), leukocytosis (white blood cells [WBC] 17,630/μl), elevated C-reactive protein (9.39 mg/dl), and hypoglycemia (30 mg/dl). Rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests on the neonate and mother were all reactive. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis disclosed a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer at 1:32, a WBC of 7/μl, and a protein level of 230 mg/dl. Diffuse osteochondritis was identified on long-bone radiographs. A course of intravenous aqueous penicillin G (50,000 units/kg/dose, every 12 hours for 1 week and thereafter every 8 hours for a total of 3 weeks) was established. Because of poor respiratory effort with undersized lungs at birth, the infant was mechanically ventilated for 17 days, with transient episodes of respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonitis.\nPersistent bleeding from venipuncture sites and hemorrhagic endotracheal aspirates were noted on postnatal day 1. DIC was identified on the hematological profile (platelet count, 20,000/μl; prothrombin time, 16.5 vs control, 10.1 to 12.6 seconds with the international normalized ratio of 1.46 vs 0.93–1.13; partial thromboplastin time, 69.3 vs 23.6 to 31.1 seconds; antithrombin III, 14%; fibrinogen, 136 mg/dl; and D-dimer, 16511.3 ng/ml DDU). Serial cranial ultrasound revealed both intraventricular hemorrhage, up to grade 2. Blood component therapy comprising fresh frozen plasma, antithrombin III, and platelet concentrates corrected the hematological indices of coagulopathy and the bleeding diathesis.\nInitial liver function tests revealed an elevated total bilirubin (6.3 mg/dl) with the direct fraction of 73% (4.6 mg/dl) and raised serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (355 and 97 IU/L, respectively) (Table ). After the initiation of penicillin therapy, the direct hyperbilirubinemia was progressive until postnatal day 4, reflecting the hemolysis at birth along with initial high AST levels (Table ). Serum ALT and AST levels were elevated in response to daily administered penicillin dosage (Table ). After a complete course of parenteral penicillin, serum bilirubin, ALT and AST reduced to the initial high levels (in AST, the level on day 3), which gradually improved thereafter but direct hyperbilirubinemia persisted (Table ). Cholescintigraphy (DISIDA scan) on day 67 depicted biliary-to-bowel transit on delayed 6-hour images.\nOn postnatal day 3, small bowel obstruction was suspected because serial abdominal radiographs showed progressive gastric dilatation with a centrally located small bowel gas and no colon gas. The infant spontaneously passed an average amount of meconium defecating ten times for the first 2 days. Total parenteral nutrition was instituted. Gastrografin enemas were performed every 24 hours for 5 days (on days 3–9 except days 5 and 6 of patent ductus arteriosus ligation and the first postoperative day) and produced small amounts of stool. Serial contrast enemas consistently demonstrated a microcolon with multiple intraluminal filling defects (meconium plugs) and no possible reflux into the distal ileum, with progressively worsening gastric and proximal bowel loops dilation (Fig. ). On day 9, at laparotomy two-thirds of the small bowel was plugged by inspissated meconium, which was not milked distally and located in the bowel segment 80 cm long (from the jejunum 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz to the ileum 50 cm from the ileocecal valve). After proximal ileotomy at 70 cm distance from the ileocecal valve and warm saline irrigation, most of the dark green and jelly-like sticky meconium was evacuated and distal loop ileostomy was performed.\nSerological assays for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Testing for thyroid functions and alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, genetic analysis for cystic fibrosis, and submucosal rectal biopsies were all within normal range.\nPostoperative follow-up was uneventful. Enteral feeding was initiated on day 14 and full oral feeding was reached on day 35. The repeated cerebrospinal fluid VDRL test on day 87 was nonreactive. The ileostomy was repaired on day 98.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of CHA Gangnam Medical Center (IRB No. GCI-20-06).

He had a fever (over 38.5°C) and neck swelling at the first visit to our hospital. Emergency computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed a tumor-like lesion and an abscess in the anterior neck region. This lesion was near the thyroid gland. He underwent surgical incision and drainage, and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was administered for 5 days after the first hospital visit. After incision and drainage, microbiological culture including anaerobic studies of the abscess showed Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melanigenica, and Streptococcus anginosus/milleri groups. We planned radical surgery for the laryngeal cancer, but prioritized treatment of the abscess.\nOn admission, his physical findings were normal except for a slight fever. His laboratory findings included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19,500/μl (87.9% neutrophils) and C-reactive protein level of 24.63 mg/dl. Plasma glucose was 106 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c was 8.1%. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable with no evidence of immunosuppression. After hospital admission, according to the susceptibilities of cultured microbes, we switched the antibiotic to meropenem (500 mg/q.12.h). However, pus from the neck abscess showed no change and his biochemical data did not improve, despite regular incisions and debridement of necrotic tissue. On the 4th hospital day, we again cultured necrosis tissue from the neck, but no microbes were isolated. Based on the diagnosis of diabetes and high suspicion of mediastinal abscess, he underwent thoracic examination on the 6th hospital day. Chest CT scan (Figure ) showed a multi-segmented low density mass in the mediastinum. Based on the laboratory findings and radiological imaging, he was diagnosed as having descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM), and immediately underwent mediastinal drainage by thoracoscopic surgery with 3 ports in the right thoracic wall (Figure ). Contents of the abscess were sampled by direct puncture of the abscess site employing a sterile anaerobic maneuver with disinfected devices. Smear studies of surgical samples showed the presence of Gram-positive bacilli in the background of WBCs without bacterial phagocytosis. Samples were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), chocolate agar (Beckton Dickinson, NJ), McConkey agar (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), Brucella HK agar (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan), and HK semi-solid medium (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industries). We performed 48-hour aerobic cultures at 35°C using 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and McConkey agar. We also performed anaerobic cultures for 48 hours at 35°C using Brucella HK agar. Gram-positive bacilli grew on 5% sheep blood agar (Figure ), chocolate agar, and McConkey agar but only under aerobic conditions. No other microbes grew in these media. The obtained isolates were negative for catalase, and neither spores nor branch formation was observed. Initially, we identified the isolates as Lactobacillus casei by BD BBL CRYSTAL™ (Becton Dickinson). Determination of MICs by microbroth dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Walkaway™ Plus Systems, Siemens, Munich, Germany) was performed according to the sample preparation and reading conditions recommended by the supplier. In short, isolated colonies were suspended in 3 ml of Inoculum Water (Siemens) until a density corresponding to the McFarland standard 0.5 (≒1.5 × 108 cfu/ml) was obtained. We then added 100 μl to Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (Siemens), and determined MICs using the MICroFast™ series, Strepto MF5 panel (Siemens). Susceptibilities (MIC μg/ml) to several antibiotics were: penicillin G 8, ampicillin 2, cephazolin ≤8, cefotiam 16, imipenem ≤1, meropenem 0.5, gentamicin ≤1, erythromycin ≤0.25, clindamycin ≤0.5, minocyline ≤2, levofloxacin 4, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ≤1, vancomycin >16, and rifampicin ≤1. Though administration of meropenem was initiated upon diagnosis of DNM, treatment was changed to ampicillin (12 g/day) as de-escalation therapy based on susceptibility testing on the 18th hospital day. We washed the abscess daily via the drain until the 42nd hospital day, and on the 45th hospital day, antibiotic administration was completed. During chest drainage therapy, we cultured neither gram-positive bacilli nor any other microbes from multiple pleural effusion samples. However, it was unclear whether other infectious sites existed because no other samples, i.e. blood or oral mucosa, were cultured. On the 63rd hospital day, he underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection followed by reconstruction using free jejunum. On the 117th hospital day, he was discharged in good condition, having received neither adjuvant chemotherapy nor radiation.\nThough the isolates were identified as L. casei employing conventional biological techniques, we accurately identified the strain with 16 s ribosomal RNA genotyping, as previously described [], and a similarity search was conducted using the BLAST program (DDBJ, Shizuoka, Japan). The results (1,501 bp; GenBank accession no. AB755630) showed 100% similarity to the reference strain of Lactobacillus pentosus (GenBank accession no. AJ292254) and Lactobacillus plantarum (GenBank accession no. AL935263). We finally confirmed the identification of L. plantarum using the recA sequence []. The results (313 bp; GenBank accession no. AB755631) showed 100% identity with L. plantarum (GenBank accession no. AL935263) [similarity to L. pentosus (GenBank accession no.

During chest drainage therapy, we cultured neither gram-positive bacilli nor any other microbes from multiple pleural effusion samples. However, it was unclear whether other infectious sites existed because no other samples, i.e. blood or oral mucosa, were cultured. On the 63rd hospital day, he underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection followed by reconstruction using free jejunum. On the 117th hospital day, he was discharged in good condition, having received neither adjuvant chemotherapy nor radiation.\nThough the isolates were identified as L. casei employing conventional biological techniques, we accurately identified the strain with 16 s ribosomal RNA genotyping, as previously described [], and a similarity search was conducted using the BLAST program (DDBJ, Shizuoka, Japan).

The patient underwent bone debridement once again in January 2010 at the same institution, as a result of her continued lower extremity pain and imaging abnormalities; pathology was again inconclusive but was thought to be consistent with osteomyelitis. The patient received several weeks of antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and daptomycin. She discontinued narcotics after this initial resection.\nThe patient was pain free until November 2010, at which time she sought an evaluation with an orthopedic surgeon and was again started on narcotic analgesics.

Molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis did not show a clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, arguing against a lymphoproliferative disorder.\nIn May of 2011, the patient underwent surgery at our institution. The cement was removed, the lesion was aggressively curettage, tissue was obtained for histology and culture, and antibiotic-impregnated cement beads were placed in the bone defect.

The orthopedic oncologic surgeon consulted with colleagues at several institutions across the country; the consensus opinion was to repeat aggressive curettage.

Approximately 1 year earlier, the patient was treated with warfarin for 6 months for an episode of pulmonary embolism and worsening heart failure, with a normal echocardiogram and no RV thrombus. She has a significant family history for thromboembolism: a cousin, carrier of MethyleneTetraHydroFolate Reductase (MTHFR) heterozygous mutation 677 C>T and prothrombin heterozygous mutation 20210 G>A, suffered a pulmonary embolism and has an inferior vena cava filter. A detailed pedigree is shown in . Her 7-year-old daughter and her sister, both with no history of thromboembolic disease, are carriers of the same mutation.\nAt admission, the patient was severely symptomatic for exertional dyspnoea. Physical examination showed no signs of overt RV failure and muffled heart sounds. Her blood tests revealed normal full blood count, blood group 0+, and elevated BNP (1543 pg/mL, normal values <100 pg/mL), and the electrocardiogram showed signs of RV overload (tall R wave in V1 and V2).

First, a 5-F cobra-shaped catheter (Terumo Clinical Supply, Gifu, Japan) was inserted from the right femoral artery.

He is of Han ethnicity and was born to consanguineous parents. His family pedigree is shown in Fig. . The proband was normally delivered after a full-term pregnancy, and birth weight and length were within normal ranges. The initial signs and symptoms appeared when he was 6 years old. Deformity of interphalangeal joints initially appeared in the fingers. Hips, knees, and wrists were then gradually involved. Diagnosis of JRA was considered by local hospitals, and glucocorticoids were prescribed without any efficacy. As he grew up, his symptoms deteriorated. He had to walk with crutches at 16 years of age because of arthritis of the lower extremities. At 26 years of age, he first experienced progressive pain with numbness radiating down his entire left leg and right thigh. At 34, he started to have mild difficulty in urination. Thereafter, his leg pain progressed and he became immobile. Treatment with tramadol, physical therapy, and spine injection were tried but were not effective. He had a younger brother with a similar clinical presentation but who also had mild neurological impairment (Fig. ).\nThe proband’s height and weight were 162 cm and 72.5 kg when he was admitted to our hospital. His visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 9. He did not have behavioral difficulties and was not retarded in his intellectual development. Physical examination showed multiple malformations of the major limb joints, especially of the knees and hands (Fig. ). Amyotrophy of both lower limbs was obvious. Cervical and lumbar movements were limited with compensatory kyphosis. The muscular strength of all four limbs was normal. Dysesthesia was found in the posterolateral left calf, dorsolateral left foot, and perineal area. Bilateral knee-jerk reflexes and ankle reflexes were hypo-induced. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (13 mm/h) and C-reactive protein level (2 mg/L) were both within the normal range.

He is of Han ethnicity and was born to consanguineous parents. His family pedigree is shown in Fig. . The proband was normally delivered after a full-term pregnancy, and birth weight and length were within normal ranges. The initial signs and symptoms appeared when he was 6 years old. Deformity of interphalangeal joints initially appeared in the fingers. Hips, knees, and wrists were then gradually involved. Diagnosis of JRA was considered by local hospitals, and glucocorticoids were prescribed without any efficacy. As he grew up, his symptoms deteriorated. He had to walk with crutches at 16 years of age because of arthritis of the lower extremities. At 26 years of age, he first experienced progressive pain with numbness radiating down his entire left leg and right thigh. At 34, he started to have mild difficulty in urination. Thereafter, his leg pain progressed and he became immobile. Treatment with tramadol, physical therapy, and spine injection were tried but were not effective. He had a younger brother with a similar clinical presentation but who also had mild neurological impairment (Fig. ).\nThe proband’s height and weight were 162 cm and 72.5 kg when he was admitted to our hospital. His visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 9. He did not have behavioral difficulties and was not retarded in his intellectual development. Physical examination showed multiple malformations of the major limb joints, especially of the knees and hands (Fig. ). Amyotrophy of both lower limbs was obvious. Cervical and lumbar movements were limited with compensatory kyphosis. The muscular strength of all four limbs was normal. Dysesthesia was found in the posterolateral left calf, dorsolateral left foot, and perineal area. Bilateral knee-jerk reflexes and ankle reflexes were hypo-induced. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (13 mm/h) and C-reactive protein level (2 mg/L) were both within the normal range.

She was also diagnosed as carrying a mutation of BRCA 2. The patient underwent bilateral mastectomy and right-sided sentinel lymph node biopsy with 1 of 6 lymph nodes being found to be positive for metastasis. Unfortunately, she declined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation recommended by her treating physicians, but only received adjuvant hormonal therapy with letrozole. In February 2012, she presented with renal failure and severe bony pain, and was found to have hypercalcemia with extensive osseous metastasis. CT-guided biopsy of one of the pelvic lesions revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with her ER-positive primary breast cancer. The patient received aggressive hydration and denosumab for hypercalcemia. She also received radiation to her sacrum and bilateral sacroiliac joints to palliate her pain. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving hormonal therapy with the combination of tamoxifen and metformin. Her monthly denosumab injection for bone metastasis was also continued. Unfortunately, her disease continued to progress, and she was found to have extensive lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, mediastinal and pelvic area. In January 2013, the patient was transferred to our center.\nAs breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers has been previously shown to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy [], treatment with single-agent carboplatin (AUC 5) was initiated. Three days after starting carboplatin, the patient developed a severe headache and projectile vomiting. An MRI of her brain revealed a large, dura-based, contrast-enhancing extra-axial mass, approximately 3.3 × 4.3 cm in size, causing severe vasogenic edema in the right frontotemporal region, resulting in a significant midline shift. She was seen by a neurosurgeon, and an emergent decompressive craniotomy was performed. The pathology of the resected mass was consistent with metastatic breast cancer. Postoperative brain MRI showed marked improvement, but unfortunately it also demonstrated some small dura-based masses over the left cerebral hemispheres. The patient recovered quickly and subsequently received whole-brain radiation therapy to treat dural metastases. Despite the delay of systemic therapy for almost 2 months due to craniotomy and radiation, her extra-cranial disease responded well radiographically to the first dose of carboplatin, and thus this agent was continued until June 2013.\nAt this time, PET-CT showed a progression of the disease in the cervical, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Carboplatin was discontinued and PLD was initiated as a second-line chemotherapy. For the first cycle, a total of 85 mg (40 mg/m2) of liposomal doxorubicin in 250 ml of D5W (5% glucose solution) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior carboplatin. PLD was infused at a rate of 1 mg/min for the first 20 min. As no infusion-related adverse effects were observed, the rate was increased to 1.6 mg/min in order to complete the infusion over 1 hour according to our standard protocol. Twenty minutes later (approximately 50 mg PLD in total was given), the patient was noted to develop confusion. She had some tangential thoughts, started to make nonsensical comments to the people around her and began to tell stories from the past. The infusion was held and she was observed for 30 min, but her symptoms did not improve. An on-call physician was contacted to assess her.

He was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Gunma University Hospital, for detailed examination and treatment for the first time in March 2015.\nHis physical status was moderate and nutritional status favorable. There was no other notable factor. On visual inspection, there was no tumor lesion in the oral cavity (Fig. ). Hypesthesia extending from the right lower lip to the mental region was noted, and the perception level was approximately 50% of that on the unaffected side. CT imaging revealed dilation of the mandibular canal (Fig. ), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregular high signal intensity on horizontal sections of short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR). On sagittal sections, dilation of the right mandibular canal was observed around the mandibular foramen. Dynamic images showed crescendo enhancement (Fig. ).\nPreoperative biopsy findings carried out at the first hospital visited by the patient suggested a schwannoma involving the Antoni A region. Briefly, the lesion was immature, suggesting the presence of an active potential. Considering the risk of future tumor growth, the tumor was extirpated under general anesthesia in late April 2015. A macroscopically observed intraoperative finding was a cystic tumor (3.2 × 1.0 cm) associated with the inferior alveolar nerve and vessels; hence, the inferior alveolar nerve was ligated/cut and extirpated as a mass (Fig. a, b). Intraoperative rapid diagnosis confirmed the absence of tumor cells at the margins of the resected nerve specimen. During the 2-year postoperative follow-up, radiopacity was enhanced at the wound site after extirpation of the tumor, confirming favorable bone outgrowth (Fig. c, d). There have been no subsequent clinical findings or images suggestive of relapse.\nIn a hematoxylin-and-eosin (H-E)-stained specimen, bundle-like tumor proliferation was observed around the nerve fiber. In addition, outgrowth of tumor cells was noted around nerve fibers, separating the nerve fiber bundle (Fig. a–c).\nImmunohistologically, the tumor cells were positive for Glut-1 and weakly positive for EMA and Claudin-1. The tumor cells were negative for S-100, but the residual nerve fibers were positive for S-100 (Fig. a–e). Based on these findings, the histopathological diagnosis was INPN. The MIB-1 expression rate of INPN, indicating its cell proliferation ability, was 1.6% (Fig. ).\nTo examine the pathogenesis of this tumor, FISH, which facilitates the detection of gene localization on the chromosomes, was carried out. In this procedure, a cloned gene or DNA fragment is labeled with a non-isotopic compound and hybridized with chromosomal DNA on a glass slide to directly detect the site of in situ hybridization, as a fluorescent signal, on a chromosome. FISH is safer and simpler than conventional autoradiography. In addition, it is advantageous as the results can be obtained in a short time. As standards, the fluorescent body of chromosome 9 (orange signal) indicates the ABL gene, that of chromosome 22 (green signal) indicates the BCR gene, and a yellow signal indicates the BCR-ABL fusion gene.

The left kidney was supplied by 2 renal arteries, one of which originated from the false lumen.

In April 2016, another contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination revealed an aneurysmal dilatation in the descending thoracic aorta with a thrombosis in the proximal part of the false lumen, warranting surgical repair ().\nThrough a posterolateral thoracotomy in the left fourth intercostal space, cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted following the cannulation of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A left ventricular apical vent was placed, and the patient was core cooled to 18 °C. The ascending aorta was cross-clamped, and the aortic root cardioplegia was administered. The transverse aortic arch was clamped between the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and the left subclavian artery. The lower thoracic aorta was clamped distally to the aneurysm, and the lower body perfusion was begun with an additional left femoral artery cannulation. The aneurysm sac was opened.

Through a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted using the right axillary artery and the right atrial cannulation. The arch of the aorta, the innominate artery, and the LCCA were looped. The ascending aorta was cross-clamped, and the left ventricle was vented through the right superior pulmonary vein. The patient was core cooled to 18 °C. An aortotomy was done, and Custodiol® HTK cardioplegia (Sandor, India) was given through the coronary ostia intermittently. The innominate artery and the LCCA were snugged, and selective unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was initiated. Bilateral cerebral perfusion was initiated by inserting a 16-F cannula into the LCCA. The intraoperative findings included a TADA involving the right coronary artery and extending into the undersurface of the arch with a severely non-coapting trileaflet aortic valve. The patient underwent a Bentall procedure with arch replacement using the composite conduit. The innominate artery and the LCCA were harvested as an island, and the arch was replaced using a 28-mm Dacron conduit. Distal anastomosis was done onto the previous graft in the descending thoracic aorta after the folded reversed elephant trunk was pulled out, incorporating the left subclavian artery onto the anastomosis. The innominate artery and the LCCA were reimplanted. Next deairing was done, the graft was clamped proximally, and the whole body circulation was re-established. The aortic root was replaced as in the standard Bentall procedure during rewarming. The root/arch replacement was completed by anastomosing the proximal and distal Dacron conduits (). The patient was weaned off bypass uneventfully. A computed tomography scan at the time of discharge was satisfactory ().\nAt 2 years’ follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal left ventricular function.''' \n\n output:", "gpt_gene": "```json\n{\n  \"originalText\": \"Three months later, the patient presented with acute onset breathlessness of 2 weeks’ duration.

After referral to our hospital, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the fluid accumulation in the abdomen was diagnosed as a retroperitoneal hematoma.\nPreviously, the patient had been followed up at our hospital for chronic hepatitis C. In addition, he had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and posterior segment resection of the liver for HCC (S6; Couinaud’s hepatic segment) 5 years before this visit and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for intrahepatic recurrence (S8) 3 years ago. The pathological findings of primary HCC are as follows. It was nodular type and showed expansive growth, fibrous capsule formation, capsule invasion, and septum formation. There was no serous membrane invasion, vascular invasion, and bile duct invasion. The liver in the non-tumor area had chronic hepatitis, and surgical margin was negative.\nHe also achieved a sustained virological response to hepatitis C virus with Ledipasvir acetonate / Sofosbuvir 2 years ago. The patient’s medical history included surgery for appendicitis, the use of stents for acute myocardial infarction, transurethral resection of a tumor in the bladder, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, and osteoporosis. His medications included aspirin, losartan potassium, fenofibrate, benzbromarone, alendronate sodium hydrate, a proton pump inhibitor, and laxatives.\nThe patient’s blood pressure and pulse rate were stable, and mild anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] level, 9.8 g/dL) was observed during the first visit at our hospital; therefore, we assumed that the bleeding had stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for follow-up. The symptoms seemed to improve for a while, but 1 week later, the patient experienced abdominal pain. The preoperative blood test showed a decrease in the Hb level to 8.2 g/dL. Contrast-enhanced CT at the time of visit showed a retroperitoneal hematoma centered in the right paracolic gutter (Fig. A). A ring-shaped contrast area was observed between the hematoma and the ascending colon. As colonic diverticula were also present, bleeding from the extramural tumor or diverticula was considered. Although there was no obvious enlargement of the hematoma (Fig. B), abdominal pain recurred in a short time and anemia progressed. Based on the above, it was judged that the bleeding could not be controlled by follow-up, and surgery was decided upon. Preoperative liver function was as follows. Total protein 6.4 g/dL, Albumin 3.5 g/dL, Total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, Direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, Aspartate aminotransferase 33 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase 23 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 104 U/L, Cholinesterase 166 U/L, Lactate dehydrogenase 240 U/L. Tumor markers were not measured preoperatively.\nOn laparotomy, a small amount of bloody ascites was observed from the pelvis to the left lower abdomen, but no peritoneal dissemination lesion was detected. Strong adhesions were found on the right side of the abdomen; the removal of these adhesions resulted in a retroperitoneal hematoma. The cause of the bleeding and he location of the tumor could not be identified intraoperatively because of the extensive hematoma. A hemicolectomy was performed on the right side, because we judged from the preoperative CT that the hematoma and tumor could be resected together (Fig. ). The total time of the operation was 217 min and the blood loss was estimated at 505 mL.\nThe patient was diagnosed with moderately differentiated HCC of the ascending colon, located mainly within the subserosal and muscular layers, where a continuous retroperitoneal hematoma was observed.

Initially, febrile episodes were characterized by high fever lasting five days and associated with arthritis and dactylitis. In her ninth month of life, the appearance of a diffuse painful skin eruption was noted, marked by nodules and plaques, erythematoedematous rash and infiltrate, resembling erythema nodosum (). The child was admitted on an almost monthly basis; on some occasions her symptoms were attributed to defined infections (mono-like), yet in other instances infections were undefined–these were somewhat responsive to systemic antibiotics. In her eleventh month of life, during another episode of fever, low levels of immunoglobulin G prompted the initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement. IVIG had an effect on infectious episodes and consequently reduced the frequency of hospital admissions, but skin rash and arthritis remained uncontrolled. A biopsied skin specimen from her left leg revealed septal panniculitis, thus confirming the clinical suspicion of erythema nodosum (). At the age of two years, while high doses of steroids improved skin and osteoarticular symptoms, the patient failed to respond to several steroid sparing agents. Due to severe side effects, steroid administration was suspended.

She had suffered a fall when skating 20 days earlier, leading to exacerbation of pain following activity. She was transferred from a local hospital, and the X-ray revealed a lytic destruction in her left proximal humerus with a suspected pathological fracture at the humeral neck. Chondrosarcoma was suspected on pathological diagnosis after fine-needle aspiration. However, she refused treatment at her local hospital and was transferred to our department for further treatment. There was a slight swelling over her left upper arm without any erythema. A slight activity restriction was detected on physical examination. Then, a shoulder–elbow belt was used to temporarily fix her affected arm.\nPlain radiographs in our hospital showed a lytic, expansible lesion with a sclerotic margin in the proximal humerus (). The following radiographic examinations including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scan were performed. CT images revealed there was predominantly lytic mixed with coarse trabeculation and densely sclerotic slight cortical destruction in the tumor (). MRI showed that the lesion presented low signals on T1-sequence, and mixed signals on T2-sequence, images with a slight enhancement (). An increased nuclear uptake at the destruction area was found on bone scan (). Cancer markers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, and CA199 were all normal. CT of chest indicated there was no lung metastasis.\nOpen biopsy was undertaken and pathological examination showed a spindle cell tumor of low-grade malignancy. Then, proximal humerus tumor en bloc resection followed by modular prosthetic replacement was carried out. The operation was performed with the patient under general anesthesia in a lateral position. The length of the tumor segment was 5.4 cm, and the resection length was 7.5 cm so that there was a 2 cm-tumor-negative margin (). The attachments of the latissimus dorsi and teres major on the humerus were severed to remove the tumor. The rotator cuff and axillary nerve were not affected by tumor. The bone defect present after tumor resection was reconstructed using a modular proximal humerus endoprosthesis (cement type; Chunglizhengda Medical Instruments Co., Beijing, People’s Republic of China). Then, the rotator cuff was sutured to the head of the prosthesis with 2–0 non-absorbable sutures (Ethibond* Excel, Polyester Suture, Green Braided, Johnson & Johnson, USA) to improve the stability of the shoulder joint. Muscles and soft tissues were reconstructed in situ. No mesh was used during the operation.

She reported sharp, constant pain, exacerbated by movement, worsening over a few days. She has had previous episodes of the similar pain with no cause for symptoms found. Pregnancy test was negative and vital observations were normal.\nHer history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, polycystic ovaries, chronic pelvic pain, and secondary subfertility. She has one 4-year-old child, which was with spontaneous conception. Subsequently, difficulty in conceiving led to subfertility workup in the past, which involved baseline hormonal analysis, pelvic ultrasound scan, and hysterosalpingogram. On day 2, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were 4.3 IU/L and 12.1 IU/L, respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 1.7 mU/L, on day 21, progesterone was one confirming ovulation, and prolactin levels were 432 mIU/L. Pelvic ultrasound scan reported that uterus and left ovary were normal with absent right ovary. Hysterosalpingogram showed unicornuate uterus with patent salpinx on the left side []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was arranged which showed a normal renal tract bilaterally and a possibility of a supernumerary ovary on the right side. She also had ultrasound kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) and computed tomography (CT) KUB in the past to exclude renal cause of her pain, which had confirmed normal renal tract bilaterally. This finding led to diagnostic laparoscopy which confirmed unicornuate uterus with absent right fallopian tube and ovary. Supernumerary ovary was not found. The patient was commenced on clomiphene therapy as was desperate to conceive. On day 21, progesterone was arranged to monitor ovulation as per our unit protocol.\nExamination during this admission elicited right abdominal tenderness with no guarding or rigidity. Baseline investigations included full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urinalysis. White cell count was 6.8 × 109/L, CRP was 1.4 mg/L, and urinalysis was negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis was arranged, which showed no evidence of appendicitis, and a normal left ovary but right ovary was not visualized. This was consistent with ultrasound and laparoscopic findings in the past. The surgical review was sought to rule out appendicitis or other surgical causes. The surgical team reviewed the patient and requested CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which, to our surprise, reported bilateral ovaries present [] with no obvious surgical pathology.\nRepeated admissions for persisting pain and the inconsistency in radiology reports, regarding the status of her right ovary, instigated multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion, where all images, reports, and case notes were reviewed. The MDT reviewed the images and noted that the right ovary was indeed present but in the right paracolic gutter behind and underneath the ascending colon. The MDT felt that this maldescended or ectopic ovary could be the cause of her chronic right-sided pelvic pain and advised removal if the pain persisted.

Report of a case and review of the literature", "patient": "A 50-year-old lady, left handed, was referred to the department of neurological surgery, because of a drug-resistant epilepsy. She had a medical history, featured by the onset of seizures since early childhood. The patient was treated over several years with a combination of different anti-epileptic drugs, but she never obtained a complete control of seizures. During the past 2 years before admission, the patient experienced the worsening of crises. These were featured by mental confusion, reduced consciousness, dyskinesia in the upper right limb, and gaze deviation towards the right side. The crises occurred with a frequency of 3–4 episodes per day and occasionally had secondary generalization. She had also hypothyroidism. When the patient was hospitalized, neurological examination revealed moderate mental impairment with slowed speech and gait. Neuroradiological assessment was performed. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a densely calcified lesion involving left temporal lobe and insula []. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the presence of a hypointense (both in T1 and T2 sequences), nonenhancing lesion, surrounded by a hyperintense area detected by long-TR sequences []. The patient was scheduled for surgery.\nThe patient was positioned supine with the left shoulder elevated and head 60° rotated to the right side and fixed by radiolucent three-point Mayfield clamp. Preoperative CT scan with and without iodinate contrast was performed after positioning. Images of postpositioning CT scan were merged with preoperative MRI and used for neuronavigation. Motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials and direct monopolar and bipolar cortical and subcortical stimulation were used for neuromonitoring. The intraoperative imaging protocol used in the present case has been previously detailed.[,,] Under general anesthesia, a left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. Using intraoperative ultrasound (i-US) and neuronavigation, lesion was approached through a trans-sulcal approach transtemporal (T1-T2). i-US revealed a hyperechoic tumor and calcifications were clearly visible. Intraoperatively, lesion was distinguishable from normal white matter, albeit, in some areas, it appeared infiltrating. Calcifications were detected and resected.

She had a medical history, featured by the onset of seizures since early childhood. The patient was treated over several years with a combination of different anti-epileptic drugs, but she never obtained a complete control of seizures. During the past 2 years before admission, the patient experienced the worsening of crises. These were featured by mental confusion, reduced consciousness, dyskinesia in the upper right limb, and gaze deviation towards the right side. The crises occurred with a frequency of 3–4 episodes per day and occasionally had secondary generalization. She had also hypothyroidism. When the patient was hospitalized, neurological examination revealed moderate mental impairment with slowed speech and gait. Neuroradiological assessment was performed. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a densely calcified lesion involving left temporal lobe and insula []. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the presence of a hypointense (both in T1 and T2 sequences), nonenhancing lesion, surrounded by a hyperintense area detected by long-TR sequences []. The patient was scheduled for surgery.\nThe patient was positioned supine with the left shoulder elevated and head 60° rotated to the right side and fixed by radiolucent three-point Mayfield clamp. Preoperative CT scan with and without iodinate contrast was performed after positioning. Images of postpositioning CT scan were merged with preoperative MRI and used for neuronavigation. Motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials and direct monopolar and bipolar cortical and subcortical stimulation were used for neuromonitoring. The intraoperative imaging protocol used in the present case has been previously detailed.[,,] Under general anesthesia, a left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. Using intraoperative ultrasound (i-US) and neuronavigation, lesion was approached through a trans-sulcal approach transtemporal (T1-T2). i-US revealed a hyperechoic tumor and calcifications were clearly visible. Intraoperatively, lesion was distinguishable from normal white matter, albeit, in some areas, it appeared infiltrating. Calcifications were detected and resected. According to the institutional intraoperative protocol for intra-axial brain tumor, we also used 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence, but the tumor was not fluorescent. When resection was deemed complete, intraoperative CT (i-CT) was performed and a small calcification was detected. The images of i-CT scan were used for updated neuronavigation, which was useful to localize and resect the small calcified tumor remnant.
