        "title": "A Disease-Modifying Approach for Advanced Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Regimen with Metformin, Liraglutide, Dapsone, and Finasteride): A Case Report",
        "patient": "A 19-year-old female of South Indian origin with precedent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and fatty liver presented for evaluation and treatment of obesity and hidradenitis suppurativa in November 2011. Pertinent history was a normal growth and development until puberty with a very active lifestyle. No family history of HS, colitis, or other autoimmune disease was present; however, both maternal grandparents had late-onset diabetes. At the age of 11 years, she immigrated to the United States with her mother and 2 months later begun menstruation. Within 4 months, she had a 45-pound weight gain. One month later, she developed fever and perianal pain, and underwent surgery for a large perianal abscess. She developed multiple skin lesions consistent with HS. Acne was seen to develop over the face, and periods became irregular. Over the next 6 months, her disease became widespread with up to 20 lesions present at any one time and intermittent perianal disease. Widespread abdominal scarring resulted in contracture of the entire body. She underwent extensive therapy over a total of 8 years with multiple episodic and continuous regimens of oral and intravenous antibiotics, numerous surgeries, isotretinoin for acne treatment, periodic metformin, and oral birth control usage, all without improvement of her disease.\nMenstrual periods caused severe flare-ups that required increased pain medication. Sleep was severely impaired.\nPhysical examination confirmed HS encompassing most of the truncal area anteriorly from the inframammary area to the groin, extending to the right axilla, incorporating nearly 40% of her body surface, with extensive muscle wasting of the extremities. Facial acne without scarring was present. Hirsutism was notably absent. Her weight was 215 pounds, with a BMI of 37, placing her at class II obesity. Laboratory results are detailed in Table and were notable for profound microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 6.2 g/dL with normal iron indices, and were considered as an anemia of chronic disease along with elevated liver enzymes that were presumed to be due to fatty liver. Her blood sugar was 117 mg/dL on average due to HbA1c of 5.7% and qualifies for pre-diabetes.\nTo offset the weight gain, an aggressive lifestyle modification program was initialed that focused on a low-carbohydrate diet primarily, since physical activity was too painful. Oral contraception was restarted to decrease the flares with menstruation. She was placed on dapsone 100 mg/day, after a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test was reported as negative. Initial minimal improvements were noted. A few months later, finasteride 5 mg/day and metformin 2,000 mg/day, followed by liraglutide 0.6 mg subcutaneously daily, increased to 1.8 mg over 2 months, were administered. She lost approximately 40 pounds (19% body weight) in a 6-month period with her lowest weight recorded at that time, with a trend of regain subsequently. Monthly follow-ups were undertaken with complete laboratory testing at each visit. The liver enzymes responded first with declines within 6 months, and resolution within a year. Leukocytosis, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia returned more gradually to normalcy at 2 years of treatment. The sedimentation rate, though greatly reduced form over 120 to 34 mm/h, is still above normal, and total proteins remain slightly above normal. HbA1c was 5.2% after 2 years and 4.9% after 3 years with average estimated blood sugar of 94 mg/d; though weight was regained (Fig. ). Blood testing was reduced to every 3 months after 2 years of the regimen since the improvements were stable and maintained.\nThe clinical course did not respond initially as well as the laboratory findings, with no improvement in the first 3 months. Then, new lesions did appear but resolved faster. The patient began to feel better and did have less intense and frequent flares about 6 months into the regimen. Nine months later, another large perianal abscess developed that required hospitalization and surgery. The perianal lesion healed completely in 3 weeks, as compared to a similar instance 3 years prior, which needed 6 months of dressings and care. The patient elected to avoid any extensive debridement. In the past year, she has not required adjunctive antibiotics, and risk of pregnancy, though addressed, has not been a concern.\nAt present, she has not had a new lesion for 6 months and has completed 3 years of the regimen, with remarkable tolerance. Axillary lesions have healed completely, groin, thigh, and perianal disease have improved 90% or more, while thoraco-abdominal lesions have improved 60% with 4–5 small areas persisting. Facial acne has improved but persisted. During the frequent follow-up visits, adverse effects were asked for routinely and weight regain was noted. No physical or biochemical abnormality was detected, and only the sedimentation rate is minimally elevated. The patient did consent to having photographs of the right axilla only: Figure , Figure , and Figure show the current condition and complete healing of the right axilla. Previous photographs were not obtained due to the contracture.",

She had previously undergone tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy under general anesthesia with no events at the age of 2.\nIn preoperative assessment, she had facial and skull asymmetry, hypoplastic and carious teeth, a degree of mandibular prognathism and mild limitation of neck movement due to torticolis. Chest X-ray showed thoracolumbar scoliosis, but there was no deviation or stenosis of the trachea and no active lung lesion (). She presented good mouth opening and belonged to Mallampati class 2. However, computed tomography (CT) showed nasopharyngeal mucosal hypertrophy with adenoid vegetation and a deviated nasal septum to the right side (). Therefore, flexible FOB was prepared for use when tracheal intubation was difficult or failed using a laryngoscope. Laboratory results were within normal ranges.\nHer height was 155 cm, weight was 46.8 kg, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were 105/60 mmHg, 105 beats/min, and 99%, respectively.

Observation of the larynx by direct laryngoscopy was unsuccessful despite complete muscle relaxation induced by rocuronium administered after confirming mask ventilation was not difficult. Cormack and Lehane (CL) grade obtained by laryngoscope was 3. Torticollis and restricted joint mobility added to difficulties. Prepared FOB was used immediately. A 6.0-mm-internal-diameter reinforced endotracheal tube was inserted orally into her trachea using FOB and fixed at the 21 cm mark over the right side of her lips after adequate positioning of the tube was confirmed by FOB. The view of FOB showed multiple polyp-like masses in the supraglottic region and her epiglottis was enlarged. The surface of the tracheal wall was rugged as there were a number of small nodules (). Despite the rugged wall, a 6.0-mm-internal-diameter tube was inserted smoothly. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (inspired 2.0 vol%) with a mixture of air/O2, continuous IV infusion of remifentanil.

The physical examination was consistent with right-side hemiplegia, right facial droop, expressive aphasia, and dysarthria. Laboratory findings were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast was not evident of any acute intracranial abnormality: hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus and showed an old infarct (Figure ).\nThe patient was deemed a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute left-sided ischemic stroke based on the duration of symptoms and the absence of absolute contraindications. The patient was started on alteplase infusion (0.81 mg/kg) with close monitoring. The patient started complaining of dry mouth three hours later and was found to have progressively worsening tongue swelling, initially on the right side and then progressively on the left side. Alteplase infusion was stopped and she was managed conservatively with intravenous solu-medrol and diphenhydramine for a suspected allergic reaction. The patient had a progressive worsening of dyspnea and tongue swelling, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient was extubated after a gradual improvement in tongue swelling following three days of intravenous steroids.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 28-year-old female presented to us in July 2015 with complaints of pain and restricted movement of the right ankle joint since 1 month. The pain aggravated on walking. There was no history of trauma and was not associated with fever, loss of weight, or any other constitutional symptoms. History and family history were non-contributory. Clinical examination revealed no inspectory findings. Palpation revealed tenderness over the anterior aspect of the distal tibia with no local rise of temperature. Range of motion of the right ankle joint was painful and restricted. X-rays revealed a well-defined expansile predominantly lytic lesion in the distal epi-metaphyseal region of the right tibia with minimal periosteal reaction seen along the medial margin suggestive of malignant tumor of the bone (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right ankle joint suggested an ill-defined eccentric expansile lesion measuring 4.3 (CC) × 3.0 (transverse) × 2.9 (anteroposterior) involving epi-metaphyseal end of the lower end of tibia causing cortical breach and having extra-osseous tissue component with the abnormal signal in flexor and extensor group of muscles with the possibility of GCT (). According to the radiological classification of campanacci the tumor was classified as a grade 3 lesions []. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits and surgery in the form of intralesional curettage with bone cement was planned. Anterior incision was taken over the distal end of the tibia. Bone was exposed, a cortical window of 3 cm × 2 cm was made (), the tumor was excised (), and curettage was done. The specimen was sent to histopathology for further examination. A thorough wash was given, and the defect was treated with 5% phenol. The cavity was filled with three layers consisting of bone graft, gel foam, and cement mixed with vancomycin, respectively (). The tumor was sent for histopathological examination which confirmed the diagnosis of GCT ().

She was previously healthy with no special medical history. Esophagogastroscopy showed a prominent luminal stenosis of the esophagus, which is apparently caused by an external pressure. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an inhomogeneous, soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinum measuring 11.9 × 10.2 cm (Fig. ).

Immunohistochemical stains of tumor cells were consistent with a GIST (strong positive for CD117, CD34, and DOG-1; negative for SMA, PCK, CK18, S-100, and desmin; Ki67 index was 8%). Molecular analysis revealed a deletion mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene.\nThe patient was counseled receiving preoperative imatinib therapy and the second-stage operation. She refused and insisted direct surgical resection. During the operation, we found that the mass pressed the inferior lobe of the left lung, distal esophagus, thoracic aorta and was adherent to the fundus of stomach, which was in favor of gastric origin instead of the esophagus. Curative resection including the tumor, lower part of the esophagus, and fundus of the stomach were performed. The tumor measured 13 × 10 × 10 cm and was well-encapsulated, firm mass with focal hemorrhage and cystic formation, and without obvious necrosis. The microscopic findings showed that the tumor cells were spindle in shape; the mitotic counts were increased to 18 per 50 high-power fields. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor cells confirmed a high-risk GIST according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) risk criteria, which was consistent with the previous report.

        "patient": "A 59-year-old man with an unremarkable medical history presented with an acute state of confusion, fever and two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures on that day. On admission, the patient was febrile (tympanic temperature of 38.1°C), his blood pressure was 137/79 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 103 beats/min, his respiratory rate was 16/min, and his oxygen saturation was 98% at room air. There were no murmurs or other abnormalities on cardiac auscultation, and examination of the respiratory system, the abdomen and anogenital region was normal. The neurological examination revealed psychomotor inhibition and left homonymous hemianopsia, without any motor abnormalities or other neurological deficits.\nThere were no abnormalities found on the laboratory studies (hemoglobin 15.23 g/dl, white blood cell count 8.70 × 103/μl, C-reactive protein 0.5 mg/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 11 mm/h), including negative results on the immunological study, seronegative status for HIV and negative serological tumor markers.\nA brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a single, large, right, frontoparietal lesion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no abnormalities, including negative results for DNA of HSV 1 and 2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and JC virus. A repeated brain MRI scan showed a worsening of the lesion, and the hypothesis of brain abscess was strongly considered (fig. ). Treatment with ceftriaxone (2 g i.v. every 12 h) combined with metronidazole (500 mg i.v. every 6 h) and dexamethasone (5 mg i.v. every 8 h) was started. Seizures were controlled with levetiracetam (500 mg p.o. every 12 h). There was no evidence of paroxysmal activity on the electroencephalogram, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis resulted negative. Blood and urine cultures were obtained before starting antibiotic therapy, also with negative results. Endocarditis was ruled out by a normal transesophageal echocardiogram.\nAfter 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy, although the neurological exam was normal, the patient again became febrile and symptomatic, complaining of a severe headache that evolved for 4 days, throbbing in nature and precipitated by Valsalva maneuver. Another brain MRI was performed, with evidence of further worsening of the lesion (fig. ).\nGiven the lack of evidence of a resolution of the lesion and the persistence of neurological symptoms, surgical drainage was performed with isolation of S. lugdunensis. The antibiogram of the isolated microorganism disclosed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, methicillin, gentamicin, and erythromycin. Transesophageal echocardiogram and blood cultures were then repeated, again with negative results.\nTreatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (5 mg/kg p.o. every 6 h) was performed during 12 weeks with a good response. There was also a favorable imaging response, with brain MRI undertaken a month after starting this therapy revealing almost complete resolution of the brain abscess (fig. ).

Chemistry showed a normal kidney and liver functions. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 22.2 mg/L (0–5 mg/L), and procalcitonin was not elevated. The serum angiotensin converting enzyme level was raised. Chest X-ray revealed complete white-out of the left hemothorax suggestive of massive PE; additionally, a contralateral mediastinal shift (Fig. ).

She had been prescribed levodopa and other medications since 2004 to treat her motor disorder, and she underwent MRI in 2013 that showed no abnormality or severe brain atrophy. She underwent FP-CIT-PET in January 2018, which showed bilateral decreased dopamine transporter binding in the putamina and caudate nuclei, with rostrocaudal and ventrodorsal gradients. The probable clinical and FP-CIT-PET diagnosis was Parkinson’s disease.\nBefore surgery, the patient’s most severe Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score in the “medication off” state was 37, while her score in the “medication on” state was 21. Her bilateral rigidity and tremor were minimal, but bradykinesia and gait disturbances were major symptoms.\nBecause our targets were selected using deep learning algorithm-based automatic targeting, manual indirect or direct targeting methods were not used. Instead, indirect targets are shown for comparison ().\nThe deep learning network model trained by 558 augmented images and validated using 360 augmented images was used for targeting. shows the deep learning-planned target coordinates and actual post-operative electrode locations.\nThe MRI image for targeting was obtained before stereotactic frame fixation using a 3T T2 MRI sequence 2 mm in thickness. Deep learning-based targeting was performed 1 day before the surgery.\nThe lead implantation was performed under local anesthesia by S-CP. The left side was operated on first. On the left side, center and medial tracks were used. Our target was close to the medial margin of the STN, and the STN signal was only recorded in the center electrode. The length of the microelectrode passage that showed the STN signals is depicted in . The microelectrode recording showed that the STN extended from −4.5 to −1.0 mm in the left center track. The electrode was positioned in the center track, with the target at a depth of +0 mm.\nOn the right side, the center and lateral tracks were used, and the STN signal was recorded from −6.0 to −1.0 mm on the right center track and on the lateral track. The electrode was positioned in the center track −1 mm from the target depth. Because deep learning-based targets are located close to the center target, center-track microelectrode recordings with STN signals directly support that the deep learning-based targets were correctly located within the STN. During surgery, electrical stimulation improved the patient’s bradykinesia.\nThe stereotactic errors are shown in and . No hemorrhagic or infectious complications occurred.\nThe patient’s post-operative UPDRS motor score, without stimulation and under minimal levodopa medication (300 mg a day), was 15. Later, her levodopa dose was increased to 450 mg a day, and pramipexole was added. Her UPDRS motor score was 13 without stimulation under medication. Electrical stimulation was turned on after 1 month. After surgery, the most effective electrodes were right 3 (2.5 V, 80 Hz, 60 μs pulse width) and left 3 (1.5 V, 80 Hz, 60 μs). At the best stimulation setting and with the correct medication, the patient’s UPDRS motor score was 7. Under right stimulation, her left bradykinesia improved from grade 2 to grade 1. Under left stimulation, her right bradykinesia improved from grade 2 to grade 1.

        "patient": "A 37 years old caucasian woman attended our clinic in her third pregnancy. Her past medical history included: bicornuate uterus, bilateral hypoacusia, a preterm vaginal delivery, and an early miscarriage. The previous follow up was uneventful, with normal blood tests, and low risk Down's syndrome screening. At 20 weeks, the anomaly scan showed a normal fetus with a five-fold set of uteroplacental anomalies: added to the known müllerian anomaly, the ultrasound showed the presence of a placenta succenturiata, with four portions, three main lobes placed in an anterior and posterior position, and one small separated cotyledon identified deep inside the funnel of an incompetent short cervix, which measured only 10 mm. Moreover, the umbilical cord seemed to be inserted into this anomalous cotyledon (). Interestingly, despite the fetus maintained an adequate growth and the umbilical artery Doppler was normal, the cerebral vessels showed an early and marked decrease of the vascular impedance in both the vertebral (VA) and the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) (RI 0.55/PI 0.86, both) Figures and .

        "title": "Perfusion Study for Internal Carotid Artery Trapping of a Traumatic Pseudoaneurysm in an Unconscious Patient",
        "patient": "A 23-year-old man was admitted with a semicomatose consciousness after getting involved in a traffic accident on driving a car. His Glasgow Coma Scale was 5T (1/T/3) and his right pupil was dilated of 5 mm without light reflex. The right facial palsy was observed. Multiple scalp contusions, the right bloody otorrhea, and nasal bleeding were seen. On the brain computed tomography (CT), there were subarachnoid hemorrhage and airs on the basal cisterns and intraventricular hemorrhage in the 4th ventricle. Sulci in the cerebral hemisphere and cisterns were effaced. And a fracture on the right petrous apex and multiple facial bone injuries were found (). His neurologic status was getting worse and his oculocephalic reflex was absent. An intraparenchymal type of intracranial pressure monitor (Camino™, Integra, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) was indwelled and ventilator with sedation was maintained with massive neurosurgical intensive care. The intracranial pressure was checked as 9 to 10 mm Hg.\nAt the 2nd day of trauma, multiple hypodense lesions on the right frontal lobe were found on the brain CT (). Brain CT angiogram was taken for evaluating the injury of intracranial artery at the 4th day of trauma, which showed an abnormal dye filling sac at the petrous apex (). The pseudoaneurysm was located at the right proximal cavernous ICA around the fracture line. It was irregular ovoid shape with anterior-medial direction in the size of 10×6 mm.\nOn the next day after the brain CT angiogram, trans-femoral cerebral angiography was done. The pseudoaneurysm grew in size and arterial dissection was also noted at the entrance of the ICA into petrous bone (). We planned to do the trapping of the pathologic ICA and get the perfusion study for evaluate the ischemic tolerance after ICA is sacrificed. We discussed the perfusion study with a specialist of nuclear medicine. She proposed the one-day protocol of SPECT, which is taking twice scans before and after the BTO in the same day. Unfortunately, the patient was sedated and unconscious, so we could not get the neurological changes during the BTO. Twenty mCi of technetium-99m-ethyl cysteinate diethylester (99mTc-ECD) was injected before the angiogram and then 40 mCi of it was given at 15 minutes in the balloon occlusion of the right ICA. After 40 mCi of it was injected, perfusion SPECT was taken. No change of vital signs was noted during the temporary ICA occlusion.

His Glasgow Coma Scale was 5T (1/T/3) and his right pupil was dilated of 5 mm without light reflex. The right facial palsy was observed. Multiple scalp contusions, the right bloody otorrhea, and nasal bleeding were seen. On the brain computed tomography (CT), there were subarachnoid hemorrhage and airs on the basal cisterns and intraventricular hemorrhage in the 4th ventricle. Sulci in the cerebral hemisphere and cisterns were effaced. And a fracture on the right petrous apex and multiple facial bone injuries were found (). His neurologic status was getting worse and his oculocephalic reflex was absent. An intraparenchymal type of intracranial pressure monitor (Camino™, Integra, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) was indwelled and ventilator with sedation was maintained with massive neurosurgical intensive care. The intracranial pressure was checked as 9 to 10 mm Hg.\nAt the 2nd day of trauma, multiple hypodense lesions on the right frontal lobe were found on the brain CT (). Brain CT angiogram was taken for evaluating the injury of intracranial artery at the 4th day of trauma, which showed an abnormal dye filling sac at the petrous apex (). The pseudoaneurysm was located at the right proximal cavernous ICA around the fracture line. It was irregular ovoid shape with anterior-medial direction in the size of 10×6 mm.\nOn the next day after the brain CT angiogram, trans-femoral cerebral angiography was done. The pseudoaneurysm grew in size and arterial dissection was also noted at the entrance of the ICA into petrous bone (). We planned to do the trapping of the pathologic ICA and get the perfusion study for evaluate the ischemic tolerance after ICA is sacrificed. We discussed the perfusion study with a specialist of nuclear medicine. She proposed the one-day protocol of SPECT, which is taking twice scans before and after the BTO in the same day. Unfortunately, the patient was sedated and unconscious, so we could not get the neurological changes during the BTO. Twenty mCi of technetium-99m-ethyl cysteinate diethylester (99mTc-ECD) was injected before the angiogram and then 40 mCi of it was given at 15 minutes in the balloon occlusion of the right ICA. After 40 mCi of it was injected, perfusion SPECT was taken. No change of vital signs was noted during the temporary ICA occlusion. As a result of the SPECT, perfusion asymmetry in the right frontal cortex was aggravated about 21% of perfusion reduction at the post-occlusion scan compared with the baseline scan before the occlusion ().

        "title": "Nonsurgical Intervention in a Preeclamptic Patient with Spontaneous Spinal Epidural Hematoma",
        "patient": "A 37-year-old woman with a history of chronic back pain and sciatica presented to our teaching hospital at 36.5 weeks' gestation in early labor. At the time of presentation, she was noted to have acute onset of mild-range elevated blood pressures (140s-150s/90s) with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.37, consistent with a diagnosis of preeclampsia. Six hours after admission, her blood pressures progressed to severe-range, with a maximum of 195/105. Per protocol, she was given IV labetalol and MgSO4 for preeclampsia with severe features. Shortly thereafter, the patient retrospectively reported that she began to have mid-back pain along with numbness, tingling, and weakness in her right lower extremity, but she did not report these symptoms initially to her healthcare team, as she was more concerned about her pelvic pain with contractions. Approximately 3 hours after the onset of her neurological symptoms, a labor epidural was administered to help control her contraction pain and blood pressures. The epidural catheter was placed uneventfully at L3-L4 with the tip threaded to the maximum height of T11. As the epidural was being placed, the patient then reported to the anesthesiologist that she had been feeling weak. The patient was noted to appear lethargic on exam, but she was able to sit up with minimal assistance for her labor epidural. Therefore, her weakness was attributed to labor. She progressed to complete cervical dilation and had a vaginal delivery with vacuum assistance due to a 5-minute prolonged deceleration on FHT.\nThe patient continued to complain of leg weakness after delivery. At 14 hours postpartum, the nurse encouraged the patient to attempt ambulation. However, even with her best efforts, the patient was unable to move her body from a distinct line below her breasts down to her toes. She also noticed numbness, burning, and electrical sensations to light touch from that line down to her toes. At this time the resident team was notified, and a Foley catheter was inserted. There was low suspicion for magnesium toxicity as she had intact reflexes with no complaints of shortness of breath, and her magnesium level was 5.9. She still had mild-range elevated blood pressures at the time, and she remained on IV magnesium for 24 hours postpartum.\nA stat CT scan of the head without contrast resulted in normal findings with no evidence of stroke. MRI of the spine showed a fluid sac suggestive of epidural blood, measuring 3.5 cm in the craniocaudal plane and 0.4 cm in the anteroposterior plane. There was also a mild-to-moderate degree of spinal stenosis at T5-T6 due to extrinsic mass effect of the epidural hemorrhage but no direct spinal cord compression (Figures and ). The patient was immediately started on IV dexamethasone 4 mg q6h. Upon evaluation by neurosurgery, the patient was not considered to be a surgical candidate because the MRI showed no clear evidence of spinal cord hemorrhage or spinal cord compression.\nOn the morning of postpartum day #1, the patient remained with paresthesia in her lower extremities and flaccid paralysis from the waist down, but she was able to wiggle her toes. Her blood pressures were predominately normal (120-140/80-90) with a few mild-range elevated blood pressures. Per protocol, she was kept on IV magnesium for seizure prophylaxis until she was 24 hours postpartum. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the spine later that day showed an epidural lesion with a hemosiderin ring that had decreased in size to 2-3 mm in maximal depth, suggestive of a resolving epidural hematoma when compared to the most recent MRI ().\nOn postpartum day #2, the patient was started on PO nifedipine XL 30 mg daily to consistently maintain her blood pressures within normal range. Her mobility improved with demonstrated flexion and extension at the hips bilaterally, in addition to return of normal sensation in her lower extremities.\nThe patient's movements and sensation continued to improve day by day while she was kept on IV dexamethasone and PO nifedipine. By postpartum day #4, the patient was ambulating with a walker and had good bladder and bowel control. On postpartum day #6, the patient was ambulating without assistance and reported complete resolution of her pain in the back and lower extremities. She was discharged home in stable condition.\nA follow-up MRI 6 weeks later showed complete resolution of the spinal epidural hematoma (). At the time, she was still ambulating independently and had full control of her bladder and bowel function.",

        "patient": "A 20-year-old man with a history of severe acne complicated by neutropenia secondary to isotretinoin use and Clostridium difficile colitis secondary to tetracycline use initially presented to an outside hospital with worsening jaundice, diffuse pruritic rash, and abdominal pain for one month. He reported an unintentional 10-pound weight loss during this period and multiple clay-colored, soft bowel movements that worsened two weeks prior to presentation. At the outside hospital, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen were done, which the patient endorsed, showed only a “thickened gallbladder.” He was discharged on ursodiol and diphenhydramine, which he was compliant with. However, he noticed worsening of his pruritic rash, which started as small, round lesions on his elbows that spread to his back and abdomen, at which time he was told by his gastroenterologist to discontinue the ursodiol. The rash continued to worsen, spreading over his entire body, which prompted his return to the hospital.\nUpon admission, the patient was alert and oriented, afebrile, tachycardic to 115 beats per minute, and mildly hypotensive (94/66). The exam was notable for bilateral lower extremity edema, jaundice, multiple enlarged, non-tender inguinal and cervical LAD, hepatosplenomegaly, and diffuse, non-blanching, flat, erythematous, morbilliform rash (Figure ). He denied chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, weakness, dysuria, or hematuria. He also denied any recent travel, sick contacts, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use, alcohol use, drug use, risky sexual behavior, blood transfusions, or new medications aside from the discontinued ursodiol.\nLab work was significant for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1572 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1392 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 148 IU/L, total bilirubin 14.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 9.9 mg/dL, protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 1.9, sodium 129 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, white blood cell (WBC) 6.5 with 25% eosinophils, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.8. Imaging of the abdomen showed gastrohepatic ligament and porta-hepatic lymphadenopathy (LAD), enlarged spleen, and a heterogeneously enlarged liver (Figure ). The patient was started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin K and had an infectious and rheumatological workup done for his acute liver failure. Of note, anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) was positive at 46.2 and anti-neutrophilic antibody (ANA) was positive at 1:320. Viral studies, lymphoma panel, and other chronic liver disease autoantibodies were negative. His ceruloplasmin was normal and his ferritin level was only mildly elevated at 300 ng/mL.\nA trans-jugular liver biopsy showed severe cholestasis and acute hepatitis with a marked mixed portal and lobular inflammatory infiltrate comprised of numerous eosinophils and plasma cells, as well as pericellular, periportal, and sinusoidal fibrosis with focal bridging (Figure ). The patient was started on intravenous (IV) steroids for presumed AIH versus drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. The patient also had an inguinal lymph node excisional biopsy, which showed histiocyte proliferation with nuclear grooves that were positive for S-100, CD-1a, fascin, langerin, CD-45, and CD-68, consistent with LCH (Figure , Figure , Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and a bone scan were done to workup LCH, both of which were negative for additional pulmonary or bone lesions. On further molecular testing, no BRAF V600E mutation, no IGH rearrangement, and no TCR rearrangement were detected.\nAfter initiating glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone), the patient's liver enzymes began to improve, and his rash resolved. However, despite high-dose IV steroids, the patient’s mental status began to deteriorate. CT of the head was negative for any acute intracranial process, and he was noted to have elevated ammonia (112 µmol/L). He was started on lactulose enemas for presumed hepatic encephalopathy with a resolution of his symptoms. Three days later, the patient began to have several, large bloody bowel movements requiring the initiation of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP). He became hemodynamically unstable secondary to hemorrhagic shock, necessitating intubation and four vasopressive agents to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg. Abdominal angiography isolated the hemorrhage to the distal branch of the right ileocolic artery requiring emergent embolization by interventional radiology (IR), which was initially successful. However, three days after embolization, the patient had progressively worsening bloody bowel movements, again requiring MTP. Interventional radiology was unable to localize the source of bleeding on a repeat abdominal angiogram, necessitating an emergent right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis to control the bleed. Unfortunately, four days after his surgery, the patient experienced severe abdominal pain with an abdominal X-ray showing pneumo-peritoneum. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing anastomotic site leak with ascites, requiring abdominal washout and placement of an ileostomy.\nThe pathology results from the resection showed ulceration and chronic active inflammation extending transmurally to the serosal surface and involving the ileocecal valve, cecum, appendix, and ascending colon. It also showed atypical histiocyte/fibroblastic proliferation positive for fascin and CD68, but negative for CD1a, S-100, HHV-8, pancytokeratin, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott methenamine silver (GMS), and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining. Cultures from the operating room grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in the blood and Citrobacter youngae in the peritoneal fluid requiring IV antibiotics (daptomycin 6 mg/kg daily and meropenem 1 g every eight hours). The patient began to clinically improve, and a collective decision with the family was made to transfer the patient to a larger referral center where he continued to improve with steroids and was ultimately discharged with close follow-up.",

He reported an unintentional 10-pound weight loss during this period and multiple clay-colored, soft bowel movements that worsened two weeks prior to presentation. At the outside hospital, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen were done, which the patient endorsed, showed only a “thickened gallbladder.” He was discharged on ursodiol and diphenhydramine, which he was compliant with. However, he noticed worsening of his pruritic rash, which started as small, round lesions on his elbows that spread to his back and abdomen, at which time he was told by his gastroenterologist to discontinue the ursodiol. The rash continued to worsen, spreading over his entire body, which prompted his return to the hospital.\nUpon admission, the patient was alert and oriented, afebrile, tachycardic to 115 beats per minute, and mildly hypotensive (94/66). The exam was notable for bilateral lower extremity edema, jaundice, multiple enlarged, non-tender inguinal and cervical LAD, hepatosplenomegaly, and diffuse, non-blanching, flat, erythematous, morbilliform rash (Figure ). He denied chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, weakness, dysuria, or hematuria. He also denied any recent travel, sick contacts, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use, alcohol use, drug use, risky sexual behavior, blood transfusions, or new medications aside from the discontinued ursodiol.\nLab work was significant for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1572 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1392 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 148 IU/L, total bilirubin 14.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 9.9 mg/dL, protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 1.9, sodium 129 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, white blood cell (WBC) 6.5 with 25% eosinophils, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.8. Imaging of the abdomen showed gastrohepatic ligament and porta-hepatic lymphadenopathy (LAD), enlarged spleen, and a heterogeneously enlarged liver (Figure ). The patient was started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin K and had an infectious and rheumatological workup done for his acute liver failure. Of note, anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) was positive at 46.2 and anti-neutrophilic antibody (ANA) was positive at 1:320. Viral studies, lymphoma panel, and other chronic liver disease autoantibodies were negative. His ceruloplasmin was normal and his ferritin level was only mildly elevated at 300 ng/mL.\nA trans-jugular liver biopsy showed severe cholestasis and acute hepatitis with a marked mixed portal and lobular inflammatory infiltrate comprised of numerous eosinophils and plasma cells, as well as pericellular, periportal, and sinusoidal fibrosis with focal bridging (Figure ). The patient was started on intravenous (IV) steroids for presumed AIH versus drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. The patient also had an inguinal lymph node excisional biopsy, which showed histiocyte proliferation with nuclear grooves that were positive for S-100, CD-1a, fascin, langerin, CD-45, and CD-68, consistent with LCH (Figure , Figure , Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and a bone scan were done to workup LCH, both of which were negative for additional pulmonary or bone lesions. On further molecular testing, no BRAF V600E mutation, no IGH rearrangement, and no TCR rearrangement were detected.\nAfter initiating glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone), the patient's liver enzymes began to improve, and his rash resolved. However, despite high-dose IV steroids, the patient’s mental status began to deteriorate. CT of the head was negative for any acute intracranial process, and he was noted to have elevated ammonia (112 µmol/L). He was started on lactulose enemas for presumed hepatic encephalopathy with a resolution of his symptoms. Three days later, the patient began to have several, large bloody bowel movements requiring the initiation of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP). He became hemodynamically unstable secondary to hemorrhagic shock, necessitating intubation and four vasopressive agents to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg. Abdominal angiography isolated the hemorrhage to the distal branch of the right ileocolic artery requiring emergent embolization by interventional radiology (IR), which was initially successful. However, three days after embolization, the patient had progressively worsening bloody bowel movements, again requiring MTP. Interventional radiology was unable to localize the source of bleeding on a repeat abdominal angiogram, necessitating an emergent right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis to control the bleed. Unfortunately, four days after his surgery, the patient experienced severe abdominal pain with an abdominal X-ray showing pneumo-peritoneum. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing anastomotic site leak with ascites, requiring abdominal washout and placement of an ileostomy.\nThe pathology results from the resection showed ulceration and chronic active inflammation extending transmurally to the serosal surface and involving the ileocecal valve, cecum, appendix, and ascending colon. It also showed atypical histiocyte/fibroblastic proliferation positive for fascin and CD68, but negative for CD1a, S-100, HHV-8, pancytokeratin, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott methenamine silver (GMS), and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining. Cultures from the operating room grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in the blood and Citrobacter youngae in the peritoneal fluid requiring IV antibiotics (daptomycin 6 mg/kg daily and meropenem 1 g every eight hours). The patient began to clinically improve, and a collective decision with the family was made to transfer the patient to a larger referral center where he continued to improve with steroids and was ultimately discharged with close follow-up.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A Korean female infant with a weight of 1460 g (27th percentile) was born to a 40-year-old primigravida primipara woman at 32 weeks’ gestation by an emergency Cesarean section for fetal distress. The mother had a history of a negative screening test 6 months before delivery and no treatment for syphilis. Apgar scores were 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Physical examination revealed a desquamative rash on the hands and feet, distended abdomen, palpable hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. Laboratory data demonstrated hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dl, hematocrit 32.7%, and reticulocyte 7.86%), leukocytosis (white blood cells [WBC] 17,630/μl), elevated C-reactive protein (9.39 mg/dl), and hypoglycemia (30 mg/dl). Rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests on the neonate and mother were all reactive. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis disclosed a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titer at 1:32, a WBC of 7/μl, and a protein level of 230 mg/dl. Diffuse osteochondritis was identified on long-bone radiographs. A course of intravenous aqueous penicillin G (50,000 units/kg/dose, every 12 hours for 1 week and thereafter every 8 hours for a total of 3 weeks) was established. Because of poor respiratory effort with undersized lungs at birth, the infant was mechanically ventilated for 17 days, with transient episodes of respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonitis.\nPersistent bleeding from venipuncture sites and hemorrhagic endotracheal aspirates were noted on postnatal day 1. DIC was identified on the hematological profile (platelet count, 20,000/μl; prothrombin time, 16.5 vs control, 10.1 to 12.6 seconds with the international normalized ratio of 1.46 vs 0.93–1.13; partial thromboplastin time, 69.3 vs 23.6 to 31.1 seconds; antithrombin III, 14%; fibrinogen, 136 mg/dl; and D-dimer, 16511.3 ng/ml DDU). Serial cranial ultrasound revealed both intraventricular hemorrhage, up to grade 2. Blood component therapy comprising fresh frozen plasma, antithrombin III, and platelet concentrates corrected the hematological indices of coagulopathy and the bleeding diathesis.\nInitial liver function tests revealed an elevated total bilirubin (6.3 mg/dl) with the direct fraction of 73% (4.6 mg/dl) and raised serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (355 and 97 IU/L, respectively) (Table ). After the initiation of penicillin therapy, the direct hyperbilirubinemia was progressive until postnatal day 4, reflecting the hemolysis at birth along with initial high AST levels (Table ). Serum ALT and AST levels were elevated in response to daily administered penicillin dosage (Table ). After a complete course of parenteral penicillin, serum bilirubin, ALT and AST reduced to the initial high levels (in AST, the level on day 3), which gradually improved thereafter but direct hyperbilirubinemia persisted (Table ). Cholescintigraphy (DISIDA scan) on day 67 depicted biliary-to-bowel transit on delayed 6-hour images.\nOn postnatal day 3, small bowel obstruction was suspected because serial abdominal radiographs showed progressive gastric dilatation with a centrally located small bowel gas and no colon gas. The infant spontaneously passed an average amount of meconium defecating ten times for the first 2 days. Total parenteral nutrition was instituted. Gastrografin enemas were performed every 24 hours for 5 days (on days 3–9 except days 5 and 6 of patent ductus arteriosus ligation and the first postoperative day) and produced small amounts of stool. Serial contrast enemas consistently demonstrated a microcolon with multiple intraluminal filling defects (meconium plugs) and no possible reflux into the distal ileum, with progressively worsening gastric and proximal bowel loops dilation (Fig. ). On day 9, at laparotomy two-thirds of the small bowel was plugged by inspissated meconium, which was not milked distally and located in the bowel segment 80 cm long (from the jejunum 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz to the ileum 50 cm from the ileocecal valve). After proximal ileotomy at 70 cm distance from the ileocecal valve and warm saline irrigation, most of the dark green and jelly-like sticky meconium was evacuated and distal loop ileostomy was performed.\nSerological assays for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Testing for thyroid functions and alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, genetic analysis for cystic fibrosis, and submucosal rectal biopsies were all within normal range.\nPostoperative follow-up was uneventful. Enteral feeding was initiated on day 14 and full oral feeding was reached on day 35. The repeated cerebrospinal fluid VDRL test on day 87 was nonreactive. The ileostomy was repaired on day 98.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of CHA Gangnam Medical Center (IRB No. GCI-20-06).

He was at work, cutting trees, and was suspended from a harness, where he suddenly experienced clenching of his right upper extremity. He then had a witnessed generalized convulsive seizure while hanging in the air and required assistance to be lowered to the ground. He had an associated headache, with no meningismus. Computerized tomography scan (CT scan) of the brain was unremarkable. Treatment was deferred at that point, as it was a single isolated seizure event. Subsequently he noticed worsening of his headache. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed and was unremarkable. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed at outpatient neurology clinic showing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein of 53 mg/dL (normal range (N) = 15-45 mg/dL), glucose – 66 mg/dL (N = 50-80 mg/dL), cell count -237 total nucleated cells (4 red blood cells (N = 0-5), differential – 8% lymphocytes and 92% segmenters), and negative herpes simplex virus (HSV)– polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He subsequently developed right-sided weakness, worsening headaches, and somnolence and was subsequently transferred to our facility to receive a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility, it was then reported that the patient had a tick bite. He was treated with antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir and doxycycline which were later de-escalated based on infectious work up). An electro encephalogram (EEG) performed during hospitalization was normal and he had no further witnessed seizures. Work-up for the more common tick-borne infections including anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis (PCR and serology), lyme serology (non reactive), and babesiosis PCR were unremarkable. West nile virus (WNV) Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was negative.

        "title": "Descending necrotizing mediastinitis associated with Lactobacillus plantarum",
        "patient": "A 69-year-old male with no past history of major illness was referred to our hospital for surgical resection of advanced laryngeal cancer. He had a fever (over 38.5°C) and neck swelling at the first visit to our hospital. Emergency computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed a tumor-like lesion and an abscess in the anterior neck region. This lesion was near the thyroid gland. He underwent surgical incision and drainage, and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was administered for 5 days after the first hospital visit. After incision and drainage, microbiological culture including anaerobic studies of the abscess showed Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melanigenica, and Streptococcus anginosus/milleri groups. We planned radical surgery for the laryngeal cancer, but prioritized treatment of the abscess.\nOn admission, his physical findings were normal except for a slight fever. His laboratory findings included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19,500/μl (87.9% neutrophils) and C-reactive protein level of 24.63 mg/dl. Plasma glucose was 106 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c was 8.1%. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable with no evidence of immunosuppression. After hospital admission, according to the susceptibilities of cultured microbes, we switched the antibiotic to meropenem (500 mg/q.12.h). However, pus from the neck abscess showed no change and his biochemical data did not improve, despite regular incisions and debridement of necrotic tissue. On the 4th hospital day, we again cultured necrosis tissue from the neck, but no microbes were isolated. Based on the diagnosis of diabetes and high suspicion of mediastinal abscess, he underwent thoracic examination on the 6th hospital day. Chest CT scan (Figure ) showed a multi-segmented low density mass in the mediastinum. Based on the laboratory findings and radiological imaging, he was diagnosed as having descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM), and immediately underwent mediastinal drainage by thoracoscopic surgery with 3 ports in the right thoracic wall (Figure ). Contents of the abscess were sampled by direct puncture of the abscess site employing a sterile anaerobic maneuver with disinfected devices. Smear studies of surgical samples showed the presence of Gram-positive bacilli in the background of WBCs without bacterial phagocytosis. Samples were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), chocolate agar (Beckton Dickinson, NJ), McConkey agar (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), Brucella HK agar (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan), and HK semi-solid medium (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industries). We performed 48-hour aerobic cultures at 35°C using 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and McConkey agar. We also performed anaerobic cultures for 48 hours at 35°C using Brucella HK agar. Gram-positive bacilli grew on 5% sheep blood agar (Figure ), chocolate agar, and McConkey agar but only under aerobic conditions. No other microbes grew in these media. The obtained isolates were negative for catalase, and neither spores nor branch formation was observed. Initially, we identified the isolates as Lactobacillus casei by BD BBL CRYSTAL™ (Becton Dickinson). Determination of MICs by microbroth dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Walkaway™ Plus Systems, Siemens, Munich, Germany) was performed according to the sample preparation and reading conditions recommended by the supplier. In short, isolated colonies were suspended in 3 ml of Inoculum Water (Siemens) until a density corresponding to the McFarland standard 0.5 (≒1.5 × 108 cfu/ml) was obtained. We then added 100 μl to Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (Siemens), and determined MICs using the MICroFast™ series, Strepto MF5 panel (Siemens). Susceptibilities (MIC μg/ml) to several antibiotics were: penicillin G 8, ampicillin 2, cephazolin ≤8, cefotiam 16, imipenem ≤1, meropenem 0.5, gentamicin ≤1, erythromycin ≤0.25, clindamycin ≤0.5, minocyline ≤2, levofloxacin 4, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ≤1, vancomycin >16, and rifampicin ≤1. Though administration of meropenem was initiated upon diagnosis of DNM, treatment was changed to ampicillin (12 g/day) as de-escalation therapy based on susceptibility testing on the 18th hospital day. We washed the abscess daily via the drain until the 42nd hospital day, and on the 45th hospital day, antibiotic administration was completed. During chest drainage therapy, we cultured neither gram-positive bacilli nor any other microbes from multiple pleural effusion samples. However, it was unclear whether other infectious sites existed because no other samples, i.e. blood or oral mucosa, were cultured. On the 63rd hospital day, he underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection followed by reconstruction using free jejunum. On the 117th hospital day, he was discharged in good condition, having received neither adjuvant chemotherapy nor radiation.\nThough the isolates were identified as L. casei employing conventional biological techniques, we accurately identified the strain with 16 s ribosomal RNA genotyping, as previously described [], and a similarity search was conducted using the BLAST program (DDBJ, Shizuoka, Japan). The results (1,501 bp; GenBank accession no. AB755630) showed 100% similarity to the reference strain of Lactobacillus pentosus (GenBank accession no. AJ292254) and Lactobacillus plantarum (GenBank accession no. AL935263). We finally confirmed the identification of L. plantarum using the recA sequence []. The results (313 bp; GenBank accession no.

        "patient": "A 59-year-old female patient with known NF1 presented at our institution with headache, without nausea or vomiting, of over a six-month duration. Multiple café-au-lait spots and axillary freckles were observed in the anterior and posterior aspect of the body during the physical examination. Focal neurological deficits and cranial nerve palsy were not found. The patient was referred for a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain (Aquilion 64®; Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). Left jugular foramen enlargement was noticed, featuring a homogeneous, well defined, low-density lesion on CT imaging. The lesion had caused expansion in the adjacent bones (). Its density was similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ().\nThe patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Achieva X-series®; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) (using a 3.0 Tesla scanner) of the brain to evaluate the lesion. An enlarged left jugular foramen with a pouch was observed, extending from the left cerebellopontine angle cistern (). This structure was isointense to the CSF signals in all sequences. Enhancement and diffusion restriction were not found following the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (), nor obvious herniations of brain parenchyma. Thus, the imaging findings were suggestive of meningocele in the left jugular foramen, identified incidentally. The laterally displaced jugular vein was compressed and the left internal carotid artery was displaced anteriorly by the mass effect of the meningocele. Annual follow-up appointments were recommended to determine progression and monitor potential enlargement of the defect over time.",

Multiple café-au-lait spots and axillary freckles were observed in the anterior and posterior aspect of the body during the physical examination. Focal neurological deficits and cranial nerve palsy were not found. The patient was referred for a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain (Aquilion 64®; Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). Left jugular foramen enlargement was noticed, featuring a homogeneous, well defined, low-density lesion on CT imaging. The lesion had caused expansion in the adjacent bones (). Its density was similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ().\nThe patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Achieva X-series®; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) (using a 3.0 Tesla scanner) of the brain to evaluate the lesion. An enlarged left jugular foramen with a pouch was observed, extending from the left cerebellopontine angle cistern (). This structure was isointense to the CSF signals in all sequences. Enhancement and diffusion restriction were not found following the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (), nor obvious herniations of brain parenchyma. Thus, the imaging findings were suggestive of meningocele in the left jugular foramen, identified incidentally. The laterally displaced jugular vein was compressed and the left internal carotid artery was displaced anteriorly by the mass effect of the meningocele. Annual follow-up appointments were recommended to determine progression and monitor potential enlargement of the defect over time.''' \n\n output:"

There was no weakness or sensory changes, and his lumbar MRI revealed a huge central disc extrusion and sequestration at central L4-5 region (). The patient was first treated with five epidural steroid injections (two by an interlaminar approach and the others by a transforaminal approach). Although this improved his pain level, the effect did not last for more than three weeks; the patient continued to complain of pain with a score of 7 on the NRS, and he could not walk for more than three minutes. His functional score on the ODI was 38.\nPEA and decompression with the inflatable balloon neuroplasty catheter were planned and prepared as described above. A caudal epidurogram, performed before the insertion of the inflatable balloon neuroplasty catheter, showed a filling defect in the anterior epidural space above the level of L5. When the inflatable balloon neuroplasty catheter was inserted and advanced to the level of L5, some resistance against the catheter was felt. Gentle adhesiolysis of the anterior epidural space by intermittent balloon inflation was performed as described for Case 1, and the spread of contrast medium above the level of disc herniation was confirmed. At the end of the procedure, a Perifix epidural catheter (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) was left at the target site through the balloon catheter lumen. After test injection of 1 ml lidocaine, 6 ml of a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1,500 IU hyaluronidase was administered through the Perifix catheter. After 10 to 15 minutes of monitoring, another 4 ml of a mixture of 10% hypertonic saline and 20 mg triamcinolone was injected through the catheter. The catheter was removed on the day of the procedure. There were no complications during the procedure. At the follow-up visit after one month, the patient's pain was found to be reduced and was scored as a 1 on the NRS. The patient had no walking limitations, and his functional status was improved, with a change in the ODI score from 38 to 2. The effect has been maintained for more than 13 months, and the patient is currently being monitored on follow-up.",

The physical examination showed mild knee swelling and a 5-cm diameter mass along the medial side of the popliteal fossa. There was no tenderness or feeling of pressure around the mass, neurological symptoms, and range of motion (ROM) limitation. The patient had neither history of illness nor trauma. Plain radiography revealed no abnormal findings, such as calcification. A lobulated cyst measuring 5×5×3 cm was identified in the vastus medialis muscle by MRI. The cyst showed a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images whereas an intermediate-high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The inhomogeneity in signal intensity was attributed to hemorrhage within the cyst (). There was no opening or stalk for direct communication between the cyst and joint cavity or combined pathology, such as meniscus tears, on MRI. Therefore, an open excisional biopsy was performed.\nWith the patient under spinal anesthesia, a longitudinal skin incision was made along the medial side of the left knee and soft tissue release was done to expose the cyst. The location of the cyst in the vastus medialis muscle was confirmed after incising the fascia. The cyst was filled with dark brown fluid suggestive of hemorrhage within the cyst (). During detachment from the surrounding tissues, communication between the cyst and the joint cavity was noted (). After complete removal of the cyst (), an opening for intraarticular communication with the joint cavity was observed and ≥5 mm fenestration of the opening in the posterior joint capsule was done to block unidirectional passage of fluid ().

        "title": "Extranodal Rosai-Dorfman Disease of the Bone Treated with Surgery and Radiotherapy",
        "patient": "A 49-year-old African American female patient first noted pain in her distal right thigh in April 2008, which was managed with narcotic medication until December 2009. The patient underwent bone debridement at an outside institution. Pathology from this initial surgery was inconclusive. The patient underwent bone debridement once again in January 2010 at the same institution, as a result of her continued lower extremity pain and imaging abnormalities; pathology was again inconclusive but was thought to be consistent with osteomyelitis. The patient received several weeks of antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and daptomycin. She discontinued narcotics after this initial resection.\nThe patient was pain free until November 2010, at which time she sought an evaluation with an orthopedic surgeon and was again started on narcotic analgesics. She was ultimately referred to our clinic and underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in March 2011, at which time was noted abnormal signal and enhancement about the bone/cement interface around the mid distal femoral bone cement with interval focal cortical erosion compatible with residual or recurrent lesion or infection. A CT-guided biopsy was performed and demonstrated lymphocytic infiltrate with increased B-cells. Molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis did not show a clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, arguing against a lymphoproliferative disorder.\nIn May of 2011, the patient underwent surgery at our institution. The cement was removed, the lesion was aggressively curettage, tissue was obtained for histology and culture, and antibiotic-impregnated cement beads were placed in the bone defect. Pathologic evaluation showed the lesion to be consistent with extranodal RDD. Pathognomonic features such as emperipolesis and replacement of the bone marrow by diffuse infiltrating of histiocytes and intervening bands of proliferating plasma cells were noted. The histiocytes stained positive for CD68 and S-100 by immunohistochemical study (). Tissue cultures were negative and the patient was taken back to surgery for removal of the antibiotic-impregnated beads and packing of the cavity with allograft bone.\nThe patient did well for approximately a year, at which time her pain recurred. Imaging indicated resorption of the bone graft consistent with recurrence of disease. The orthopedic oncologic surgeon consulted with colleagues at several institutions across the country; the consensus opinion was to repeat aggressive curettage. This procedure was performed followed by packing of the bone defect with allograft bone in July 2012. Pathology examination again confirmed extranodal RDD, with the same features as before.\nUnfortunately, the patient’s pain recurred once again in January 2013 and imaging was again consistent with recurrent disease. At that time she was referred to the radiation oncology clinic. She was complaining of severe right lower extremity pain that was exacerbated by movement. The pain would last for several days and only resolve with narcotic medication and bed rest. Repeat imaging in April 2013 (Figure 2A) noted a lobulated focus of signal abnormality and enhancement along the postero-lateral aspect of the femoral shaft at the posterior-superior margin of the bone graft window defect, which was worrisome for recurrence. On exam, she had weakness of the right lower extremity with pain on knee extension and tenderness to palpation of the surgical incision region in the lateral distal thigh. No significant edema, skin discoloration or warmth was noted. The patient was ambulating with the assistance of a walker and required a wheelchair to move around the clinic. The decision was made to proceed with palliative external beam radiotherapy, 30 Gy in 15 fractions (). The dose was selected after conducting a literature review to determine the dose response of this disease to radiotherapy. Though limited evidence is available, it appeared that there are a high rate of non-responders if a dose less than 30 Gy is utilized. After 5 fractions over the course of five days, the patient’s pain resolved entirely. She no longer required pain medication and was ambulating without assistance. She experienced no adverse events from the radiation. She began physical therapy and rehabilitation shortly after completion of radiotherapy. At her first follow-up in June 2013, the patient had no clinical symptoms. Initial follow-up MRI noted an area of signal abnormality and enhancement at both the proximal and distal aspects of the curettage bed that had increased in prominence; due to the patient’s lack of symptoms, this was felt to be inflammation related to radiotherapy, and the decision was made to continue observation. Subsequent imaging in October 2013 and January 2014 found this area to be stable, and the patient remained asymptomatic (Figure 2B). At the time of report, the patient had been disease free and asymptomatic for approximately 15 months.",

She has a significant family history for thromboembolism: a cousin, carrier of MethyleneTetraHydroFolate Reductase (MTHFR) heterozygous mutation 677 C>T and prothrombin heterozygous mutation 20210 G>A, suffered a pulmonary embolism and has an inferior vena cava filter. A detailed pedigree is shown in . Her 7-year-old daughter and her sister, both with no history of thromboembolic disease, are carriers of the same mutation.\nAt admission, the patient was severely symptomatic for exertional dyspnoea. Physical examination showed no signs of overt RV failure and muffled heart sounds. Her blood tests revealed normal full blood count, blood group 0+, and elevated BNP (1543 pg/mL, normal values <100 pg/mL), and the electrocardiogram showed signs of RV overload (tall R wave in V1 and V2). The patient was haemodynamically stable; her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, and her heart rate 89 b.p.m.\nThe echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, dilated right atrium (End Systolic Area (ESA): 40 cm2), enlarged right ventricle with qualitatively reduced function, and an intraventricular mass partially obliterating the ventricular cavity, normal pulmonary valve function, and estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of 26 mmHg. At first, to rule out the hypothesis of cardiac neoplasm, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed large hypodense mass with no enhancement compatible with a massive thrombus involving the right ventricle, the right atrium, and the superior vena cava (), though with no evidence of pulmonary embolism and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Neoplastic markers were negative besides elevated Ca 125 (113.3 U/mL—normal values 0–35 U/mL). Positron emission tomography (PET) did not detect any lesion with increased metabolism. Thus, the initial suspicion of neoplasm was excluded.\nLower limbs and abdomen ultrasounds showed no deep vein thrombosis and normal cave-portal system. However, at that stage, the diagnosis of EMF could not have been excluded.\nThe cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal left ventricle and confirmed the presence of a large hypointense mass in T1 with no gadolinium enhancement compatible with a massive thrombus partially obliterating the right heart and involving the RV apex on top of possible endocardial fibrosis ( and and Video 1) suggesting underlying obliterative cardiomyopathy or spontaneous massive thrombosis of the right ventricle. The RV function was qualitatively reduced as well.\nDue to ineffective treatment with heparin and anticoagulants for 10 days, the patient required surgical debulking of the right cavities and a mechanical tricuspid valve replacement (ON-X 27–33). Histology revealed a large area of stratified thrombosis, with an underlying area of endocardial fibrosis, caused either by primary fibrosis or direct compression on the ventricular wall by the thrombus, although not meeting the criteria for EMF ().\nDespite multimodality imaging raised the suspicion for cardiac thrombus, definite diagnosis have been reached only after histology.\nImmediately after surgery, the patient rapidly recovered and progressively normalized the RV systolic function.\nA complete thrombophilia screening showed MTHFR heterozygous mutation for polymorphism 677 C>T and 1298 A>C and elevated factor VIII activity (187%—normal values 50–150, confirmed 6 months after the acute phase) in the absence of other thrombophilic mutations ().\nThe patient has been discharged from the hospital in good conditions with lifetime oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin aiming a target INR between 2.5 and 3.5 due to the high thrombophilic profile and the mechanical tricuspid valve replacement.",

        "patient": "In March 2017, a 56-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed by a dermatologist in the outpatient clinic of the neighboring hospital with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) including skin ulcers and erosion on both feet and fingers. Following this diagnosis, the patient began to suffer left leg pain, with the pain increasing. Prednisolone was administrated at the dose of 20 mg daily, but the pain continued. This resulted in the patient being admitted to the authors' hospital for the examination of the left femur pain in January 2018.\nOn admission, the patient was 156.2 cm tall and weighed 55.4 kg, with a blood pressure of 124/65 mmHg. Laboratory tests were conducted including serum creatinine (1.19 mg/dL), and C-reactive protein (0.2 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor (RF) was negative at 1 U/mL (normal: <10 U/mL), cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were negative at <0.5 U/mL (normal <4.5 U/mL), and all autoantibodies were negative, including antinuclear antibody (ANA). Serum complement component 3 (C3) was 106 mg/dL (normal: >86 mg/dL), complement component 4 (C4) was 18 mg/dL (normal: >17 mg/dL), and total complement (CH50) was 44 U/mL (normal: >30 U/mL). The serum level of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 1705 mg/dL (normal: 870 to 1700 mg/dL), immunoglobulin A (IgA) was 265.9 mg/dL (normal: 110 to 410), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 61.2 mg/dL (normal: 33 to 190).

The atlantooccipital membrane was removed and the dura opened with a midline incision between C0 and C1. A lateral extension of the dural incision under microscopic view was performed close to the entry of the vertebral artery. The posterior cord, the denticulate ligament, the spinal fascicles of the accessory nerve, and the entrance of the vertebral artery were clearly visible. The denticulate ligament was incised and an 8.0 suture was placed at the origin of the denticulate ligament, which was used to elevate and slightly torquate the upper cervical cord in order to achieve a broader view of the space anterior of the spinal cord, the tumor surface, and the lower cranial nerves. The tumor was soft but quite highly vascularized. After enucleation with a sharp dissector, suction, and bipolar coagulation of the tumor capsule, the tumor could finally be completely resected. Again, a Simpson °II resection was achieved. The endoscopic view confirmed complete tumor resection without tumor remnants on the clivus, both vertebral arteries and basilar artery.

        "patient": "A 65-year-old man was referred with a history of repeated episodes of unconsciousness. The patient had no history of trauma, liver biopsy, or liver disease. Gastrectomy had been performed for gastric cancer 3 years previously, and at the time of admission the patient was free from tumor. A review of the entire family tree revealed no inherited disorder. Laboratory studies showed no liver dysfunction with the exception of a mild increase in the serum ammonia level (147 μg/dl; normal range, <79 μg/dl). Contrast-enhanced multidetector-row CT revealed a large abnormal vessel in communication with a peripheral right portal branch and the right hepatic vein, which suggested the existence of an IPSVS. The shunt was 15 mm in diameter. These findings confirmed that a hepatic encephalopathy caused by an IPSVS was responsible for the repeated episodes of unconsciousness. Therefore, we attempted embolization of the IPSVS.\nAfter the patient provided written informed consent, the following procedures were performed with the patient under local anesthesia. First, a 5-F cobra-shaped catheter (Terumo Clinical Supply, Gifu, Japan) was inserted from the right femoral artery. Then, superior mesenteric arterial portography was performed, which confirmed the presence of an IPSVS forming a communication between the right portal vein and the right hepatic vein. Next, a 6-F sheath introducer (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the right femoral vein after which a 6-F hook-shaped guiding catheter (Terumo Clinical Supply) was advanced to the right hepatic vein. Subsequently, a 3.3-F micro-balloon catheter (Fuji Systems, Fukushima, Japan) with a balloon 10 mm in diameter was advanced through the guiding catheter into the right hepatic vein. Third, a 5-F sheath introducer (Medikit) was inserted from the right femoral vein to accommodate a 5-F hook-shaped catheter (Terumo Clinical Supply). The 5-F hook-shaped catheter was inserted into the right hepatic vein, followed by coaxial passage by a 0.018-inch micro-catheter (Renegade; Boston Scientific, Watertown, MA, USA) through the IPSVS into the portal vein (Fig. a). Fourth, the balloon of the micro-balloon catheter was inflated to decrease hepatofugal blood flow in the intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt and to avoid migration of the coils to the systemic venous site. Injection of the contrast medium via the micro-catheter advanced into the portal vein showed stasis of hepatofugal blood flow in the IPSVS. Fifth, the micro-catheter was re-positioned in the IPSVS, and 11 GDCs (GDC-18, 360°; diameter, 10–16 mm; length, 30 cm; and GDC-18 fibered-Vortx, diameter 4–6 mm) were placed in the IPSVS from the micro-catheter. Superior mesenteric arterial portography obtained after the balloon was deflated showed sufficient embolization of the IPSVS (Fig. b). Finally, all catheters were withdrawn. There were no procedural complications, and liver function was consistently normal after embolization. The serum ammonia level had normalized to 66 μg/dl the day following the procedure. Enhanced multidetector row CT obtained 1 week after the procedure revealed sufficient embolization of the IPSVS.\nCurrently, 14 months after this interventional procedure, the patient has no symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy and his clinical condition is good.",

He had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cerebral vascular disease. On examination of the hand, there was a 7 cm x 6 cm soft, non-tender, and immobile mass on the lateral aspect of the left hand, with no tethering to the overlying skin. There was a full range of movement of his wrist joint and fingers, and there were no neurological deficits. Repeat examination a few months later revealed that the mass had increased in size, ulcerated, and began to bleed (Figure ).\nAn initial ultrasound scan demonstrated a large mass arising from the radial wrist, measuring approximately 6.4 cm x 5.3 cm x 2.7 cm. Before a biopsy was attempted, a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was performed to rule out any aneurysm within the mass. This demonstrated that the mass had increased in size (diameter of 8.5 cm) after two months. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of the hand mass was performed: this displayed moderately pleomorphic epithelioid spindle cells within a myxoid stroma containing thin-walled and compressed vessels. These features were suggestive of a spindle cell sarcoma.\nA CT scan performed two months later demonstrated a mass lesion measuring 12.5 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm, centered around the level of the radiocarpal joint and enveloped the radial artery. A staging CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a single 4-mm nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung. This was thought to be a simple nodule, and, therefore, a surveillance CT scan of the chest was booked to take place in four months.\nBecause of extreme pain and bleeding from the tumor, neoadjuvant radiotherapy was given to reduce tumor size and relieve pain. However, despite the radiotherapy, there was no appreciable improvement in size or symptoms. After extensive multidisciplinary team discussions, a left above-the-elbow amputation with wide safety margins was performed to provide the patient with a better quality of life. Histopathology examination of the post-surgical specimen illustrated ovoid-spindle cells and pleomorphic tumor cells with no definite line of differentiation (mitotic count more than 20 per 10 high-power fields in some areas). The immunohistochemical examination demonstrated negative staining for S-100 and CD34, scanty staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and patchy positive staining for desmin. These features confirmed a high-grade (grade 3) UPS (Figure ).\nSeven months later, the patient presented to the emergency department with a productive cough and confusion. A chest X-ray revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary metastases (Figure ). In view of these findings, a palliative approach was deemed appropriate and a referral was made to the Macmillan Cancer Support Team.",

The proband was normally delivered after a full-term pregnancy, and birth weight and length were within normal ranges. The initial signs and symptoms appeared when he was 6 years old. Deformity of interphalangeal joints initially appeared in the fingers. Hips, knees, and wrists were then gradually involved. Diagnosis of JRA was considered by local hospitals, and glucocorticoids were prescribed without any efficacy. As he grew up, his symptoms deteriorated. He had to walk with crutches at 16 years of age because of arthritis of the lower extremities. At 26 years of age, he first experienced progressive pain with numbness radiating down his entire left leg and right thigh. At 34, he started to have mild difficulty in urination. Thereafter, his leg pain progressed and he became immobile. Treatment with tramadol, physical therapy, and spine injection were tried but were not effective. He had a younger brother with a similar clinical presentation but who also had mild neurological impairment (Fig. ).\nThe proband’s height and weight were 162 cm and 72.5 kg when he was admitted to our hospital. His visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 9. He did not have behavioral difficulties and was not retarded in his intellectual development. Physical examination showed multiple malformations of the major limb joints, especially of the knees and hands (Fig. ). Amyotrophy of both lower limbs was obvious. Cervical and lumbar movements were limited with compensatory kyphosis. The muscular strength of all four limbs was normal. Dysesthesia was found in the posterolateral left calf, dorsolateral left foot, and perineal area. Bilateral knee-jerk reflexes and ankle reflexes were hypo-induced. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (13 mm/h) and C-reactive protein level (2 mg/L) were both within the normal range. Tests for rheumatoid factors were negative.\nSpinal x-rays showed flat and osteoporotic vertebral bodies. Pedicles were short, and end plates were irregular. Bone bridges were seen at many levels.

        "title": "Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin-Induced Acute Transient Encephalopathy in a Patient with Breast Cancer: A Case Report",
        "patient": "A 57-year-old Caucasian woman was originally diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in her right breast in February 2011 (ER-positive, PR-positive and HER2-negative). She was also diagnosed as carrying a mutation of BRCA 2. The patient underwent bilateral mastectomy and right-sided sentinel lymph node biopsy with 1 of 6 lymph nodes being found to be positive for metastasis. Unfortunately, she declined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation recommended by her treating physicians, but only received adjuvant hormonal therapy with letrozole. In February 2012, she presented with renal failure and severe bony pain, and was found to have hypercalcemia with extensive osseous metastasis. CT-guided biopsy of one of the pelvic lesions revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with her ER-positive primary breast cancer. The patient received aggressive hydration and denosumab for hypercalcemia. She also received radiation to her sacrum and bilateral sacroiliac joints to palliate her pain. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving hormonal therapy with the combination of tamoxifen and metformin. Her monthly denosumab injection for bone metastasis was also continued. Unfortunately, her disease continued to progress, and she was found to have extensive lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, mediastinal and pelvic area. In January 2013, the patient was transferred to our center.\nAs breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers has been previously shown to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy [], treatment with single-agent carboplatin (AUC 5) was initiated. Three days after starting carboplatin, the patient developed a severe headache and projectile vomiting. An MRI of her brain revealed a large, dura-based, contrast-enhancing extra-axial mass, approximately 3.3 × 4.3 cm in size, causing severe vasogenic edema in the right frontotemporal region, resulting in a significant midline shift. She was seen by a neurosurgeon, and an emergent decompressive craniotomy was performed. The pathology of the resected mass was consistent with metastatic breast cancer. Postoperative brain MRI showed marked improvement, but unfortunately it also demonstrated some small dura-based masses over the left cerebral hemispheres. The patient recovered quickly and subsequently received whole-brain radiation therapy to treat dural metastases. Despite the delay of systemic therapy for almost 2 months due to craniotomy and radiation, her extra-cranial disease responded well radiographically to the first dose of carboplatin, and thus this agent was continued until June 2013.\nAt this time, PET-CT showed a progression of the disease in the cervical, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Carboplatin was discontinued and PLD was initiated as a second-line chemotherapy. For the first cycle, a total of 85 mg (40 mg/m2) of liposomal doxorubicin in 250 ml of D5W (5% glucose solution) was prescribed with the same premedications used for the prior carboplatin. PLD was infused at a rate of 1 mg/min for the first 20 min. As no infusion-related adverse effects were observed, the rate was increased to 1.6 mg/min in order to complete the infusion over 1 hour according to our standard protocol. Twenty minutes later (approximately 50 mg PLD in total was given), the patient was noted to develop confusion. She had some tangential thoughts, started to make nonsensical comments to the people around her and began to tell stories from the past. The infusion was held and she was observed for 30 min, but her symptoms did not improve. An on-call physician was contacted to assess her. She was found to be alert and oriented and also able to answer questions appropriately. There were no neurological deficits. As the patient had an MRI earlier that day, no further imaging studies were performed. The infusion was discontinued due to the mental status change, and the patient was observed closely. Her symptoms persisted for 18 h and then resolved spontaneously. The patient's acute transient encephalopathy was deemed secondary to PLD. When she returned for the second cycle of chemotherapy, she was not rechallenged with PLD; instead, she was being administered conventional doxorubicin. This agent was tolerated well without any mental status change for another 5 months. Unfortunately, the patient developed a disease progression, requiring further palliative therapy with an eventual transfer to a hospice service, where she died 2 months later.",

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a round radiolucent area in the right mandibular body, and biopsy was carried out, leading to a diagnosis of schwannoma. He was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Gunma University Hospital, for detailed examination and treatment for the first time in March 2015.\nHis physical status was moderate and nutritional status favorable. There was no other notable factor. On visual inspection, there was no tumor lesion in the oral cavity (Fig. ). Hypesthesia extending from the right lower lip to the mental region was noted, and the perception level was approximately 50% of that on the unaffected side. CT imaging revealed dilation of the mandibular canal (Fig. ), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregular high signal intensity on horizontal sections of short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR). On sagittal sections, dilation of the right mandibular canal was observed around the mandibular foramen. Dynamic images showed crescendo enhancement (Fig. ).\nPreoperative biopsy findings carried out at the first hospital visited by the patient suggested a schwannoma involving the Antoni A region. Briefly, the lesion was immature, suggesting the presence of an active potential. Considering the risk of future tumor growth, the tumor was extirpated under general anesthesia in late April 2015. A macroscopically observed intraoperative finding was a cystic tumor (3.2 × 1.0 cm) associated with the inferior alveolar nerve and vessels; hence, the inferior alveolar nerve was ligated/cut and extirpated as a mass (Fig. a, b). Intraoperative rapid diagnosis confirmed the absence of tumor cells at the margins of the resected nerve specimen. During the 2-year postoperative follow-up, radiopacity was enhanced at the wound site after extirpation of the tumor, confirming favorable bone outgrowth (Fig. c, d). There have been no subsequent clinical findings or images suggestive of relapse.\nIn a hematoxylin-and-eosin (H-E)-stained specimen, bundle-like tumor proliferation was observed around the nerve fiber. In addition, outgrowth of tumor cells was noted around nerve fibers, separating the nerve fiber bundle (Fig. a–c).\nImmunohistologically, the tumor cells were positive for Glut-1 and weakly positive for EMA and Claudin-1. The tumor cells were negative for S-100, but the residual nerve fibers were positive for S-100 (Fig. a–e). Based on these findings, the histopathological diagnosis was INPN. The MIB-1 expression rate of INPN, indicating its cell proliferation ability, was 1.6% (Fig. ).\nTo examine the pathogenesis of this tumor, FISH, which facilitates the detection of gene localization on the chromosomes, was carried out. In this procedure, a cloned gene or DNA fragment is labeled with a non-isotopic compound and hybridized with chromosomal DNA on a glass slide to directly detect the site of in situ hybridization, as a fluorescent signal, on a chromosome. FISH is safer and simpler than conventional autoradiography. In addition, it is advantageous as the results can be obtained in a short time. As standards, the fluorescent body of chromosome 9 (orange signal) indicates the ABL gene, that of chromosome 22 (green signal) indicates the BCR gene, and a yellow signal indicates the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Cellular signals on INPN were visually counted and classified. Measurement criteria for detecting the ALK fusion gene using the FISH method were quoted as diagnostic criteria. The principle is similar to that of BCR-ABL fusion gene detection. Samples with < 5 positive cells per 50 cells (< 5/50 or < 10%) were regarded as negative, and those with > 25 positive cells per 50 cells (> 25/50 or > 50%) were regarded as positive. The results showed that signals suggestive of BCR-ABL fusion gene formation were observed in 30 of 50 cells. In 12 of the 50 cells, the green signal of the BCR gene was present in the absence of fusion gene signals, suggesting deletion of the BCR region. Thus, 42 of the 50 cells were positive, suggesting chromosome 22 abnormalities. According to the above diagnostic criteria, our patient was regarded as having a chromosome 22 abnormality. Based on this finding, it was confirmed that this disease was a tumorous lesion (Fig. ).",

He was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Gunma University Hospital, for detailed examination and treatment for the first time in March 2015.\nHis physical status was moderate and nutritional status favorable. There was no other notable factor. On visual inspection, there was no tumor lesion in the oral cavity (Fig. ). Hypesthesia extending from the right lower lip to the mental region was noted, and the perception level was approximately 50% of that on the unaffected side.

        "title": "Reversed Elephant Trunk Technique for the Repair of Type B Aortic Dissection: A Case Report",
        "patient": "A 48-year-old asymptomatic man was diagnosed with a type B aortic dissection, moderate aortic regurgitation, and a good biventricular function in March 2012. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination confirmed that the dissection originated distally to the left subclavian artery and traversed into the right common iliac artery. The left kidney was supplied by 2 renal arteries, one of which originated from the false lumen. The patient was managed conservatively with yearly serial echocardiography and computed tomography scan. In April 2016, another contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination revealed an aneurysmal dilatation in the descending thoracic aorta with a thrombosis in the proximal part of the false lumen, warranting surgical repair ().\nThrough a posterolateral thoracotomy in the left fourth intercostal space, cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted following the cannulation of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A left ventricular apical vent was placed, and the patient was core cooled to 18 °C. The ascending aorta was cross-clamped, and the aortic root cardioplegia was administered. The transverse aortic arch was clamped between the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and the left subclavian artery. The lower thoracic aorta was clamped distally to the aneurysm, and the lower body perfusion was begun with an additional left femoral artery cannulation. The aneurysm sac was opened. The clots and thrombus were evacuated from the false lumen. The true lumen was entered, and the intercostal arteries above the level of T6 were suture closed. The dissection flap was excised, and the aneurysm was replaced with a 30-mm interposition Dacron inlay graft (gelatin-sealed Uni-Graft® graft [B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany]) using a proximal first technique with a “reversed elephant trunk” left within ().\nDistal anastomosis was performed after fenestrating the septum widely, with it including the intercostals below T6 level. The patient’s postoperative period was uneventful, and transthoracic echocardiography at the time of discharge was satisfactory.\nThree months later, the patient presented with acute onset breathlessness of 2 weeks’ duration. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (TADA) with severe aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction. He underwent a Bentall procedure with arch replacement using a 28-mm Dacron conduit incorporated with a 25-mm St. Jude aortic bileaflet mechanical prosthesis. Through a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted using the right axillary artery and the right atrial cannulation. The arch of the aorta, the innominate artery, and the LCCA were looped. The ascending aorta was cross-clamped, and the left ventricle was vented through the right superior pulmonary vein. The patient was core cooled to 18 °C. An aortotomy was done, and Custodiol® HTK cardioplegia (Sandor, India) was given through the coronary ostia intermittently. The innominate artery and the LCCA were snugged, and selective unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was initiated. Bilateral cerebral perfusion was initiated by inserting a 16-F cannula into the LCCA. The intraoperative findings included a TADA involving the right coronary artery and extending into the undersurface of the arch with a severely non-coapting trileaflet aortic valve. The patient underwent a Bentall procedure with arch replacement using the composite conduit. The innominate artery and the LCCA were harvested as an island, and the arch was replaced using a 28-mm Dacron conduit. Distal anastomosis was done onto the previous graft in the descending thoracic aorta after the folded reversed elephant trunk was pulled out, incorporating the left subclavian artery onto the anastomosis. The innominate artery and the LCCA were reimplanted. Next deairing was done, the graft was clamped proximally, and the whole body circulation was re-established. The aortic root was replaced as in the standard Bentall procedure during rewarming. The root/arch replacement was completed by anastomosing the proximal and distal Dacron conduits (). The patient was weaned off bypass uneventfully. A computed tomography scan at the time of discharge was satisfactory ().\nAt 2 years’ follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal left ventricular function.",

        "title": "Colonic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma with repeated retroperitoneal bleeding: a case report",
        "patient": "An 80-year-old man visited a primary care physician, complaining of pain in the lower abdomen on the right side and fever An evaluation of the blood sample showed an increased inflammatory response, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed fluid retention in the right side of the abdomen. After referral to our hospital, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the fluid accumulation in the abdomen was diagnosed as a retroperitoneal hematoma.\nPreviously, the patient had been followed up at our hospital for chronic hepatitis C. In addition, he had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and posterior segment resection of the liver for HCC (S6; Couinaud’s hepatic segment) 5 years before this visit and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for intrahepatic recurrence (S8) 3 years ago. The pathological findings of primary HCC are as follows. It was nodular type and showed expansive growth, fibrous capsule formation, capsule invasion, and septum formation. There was no serous membrane invasion, vascular invasion, and bile duct invasion. The liver in the non-tumor area had chronic hepatitis, and surgical margin was negative.\nHe also achieved a sustained virological response to hepatitis C virus with Ledipasvir acetonate / Sofosbuvir 2 years ago. The patient’s medical history included surgery for appendicitis, the use of stents for acute myocardial infarction, transurethral resection of a tumor in the bladder, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, and osteoporosis. His medications included aspirin, losartan potassium, fenofibrate, benzbromarone, alendronate sodium hydrate, a proton pump inhibitor, and laxatives.\nThe patient’s blood pressure and pulse rate were stable, and mild anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] level, 9.8 g/dL) was observed during the first visit at our hospital; therefore, we assumed that the bleeding had stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for follow-up. The symptoms seemed to improve for a while, but 1 week later, the patient experienced abdominal pain. The preoperative blood test showed a decrease in the Hb level to 8.2 g/dL. Contrast-enhanced CT at the time of visit showed a retroperitoneal hematoma centered in the right paracolic gutter (Fig. A). A ring-shaped contrast area was observed between the hematoma and the ascending colon. As colonic diverticula were also present, bleeding from the extramural tumor or diverticula was considered. Although there was no obvious enlargement of the hematoma (Fig. B), abdominal pain recurred in a short time and anemia progressed. Based on the above, it was judged that the bleeding could not be controlled by follow-up, and surgery was decided upon. Preoperative liver function was as follows. Total protein 6.4 g/dL, Albumin 3.5 g/dL, Total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, Direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, Aspartate aminotransferase 33 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase 23 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 104 U/L, Cholinesterase 166 U/L, Lactate dehydrogenase 240 U/L. Tumor markers were not measured preoperatively.\nOn laparotomy, a small amount of bloody ascites was observed from the pelvis to the left lower abdomen, but no peritoneal dissemination lesion was detected. Strong adhesions were found on the right side of the abdomen; the removal of these adhesions resulted in a retroperitoneal hematoma. The cause of the bleeding and he location of the tumor could not be identified intraoperatively because of the extensive hematoma. A hemicolectomy was performed on the right side, because we judged from the preoperative CT that the hematoma and tumor could be resected together (Fig. ). The total time of the operation was 217 min and the blood loss was estimated at 505 mL.\nThe patient was diagnosed with moderately differentiated HCC of the ascending colon, located mainly within the subserosal and muscular layers, where a continuous retroperitoneal hematoma was observed. This tumor was similar to the tumor resected 5 years ago and was diagnosed as metastasis of the ascending colon (Fig. ). The Elastica-van Gieson stain showed vascular invasion of the metastatic tumor, which was considered to be hematogenous metastasis.\nThe patient resumed drinking water and taking oral medications on the first postoperative day (POD). Paralytic bowel obstruction occurred during the postoperative course, but improved with conservative treatment, and the patient was discharged home on the 20th POD without any other complications.\nAfter the patient was discharged from the hospital, he was followed up without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy at his own request. However, 6 months after surgery, CT showed peritoneal dissemination, and lenvatinib 8 mg was started on a daily administration as a patient with unresectable HCC. Because of side effects such as decreased appetite, the dose was reduced and the administration interval was spaced accordingly. However, 15 months after surgery, he presented with intrahepatic, lymph node recurrence. The same chemotherapy was continued thereafter, but the progression of the disease could not be controlled. 26 months after surgery, he was switched to palliative care and his postoperative survival time was 30 months.",

After referral to our hospital, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the fluid accumulation in the abdomen was diagnosed as a retroperitoneal hematoma.\nPreviously, the patient had been followed up at our hospital for chronic hepatitis C. In addition, he had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and posterior segment resection of the liver for HCC (S6; Couinaud’s hepatic segment) 5 years before this visit and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for intrahepatic recurrence (S8) 3 years ago. The pathological findings of primary HCC are as follows. It was nodular type and showed expansive growth, fibrous capsule formation, capsule invasion, and septum formation. There was no serous membrane invasion, vascular invasion, and bile duct invasion. The liver in the non-tumor area had chronic hepatitis, and surgical margin was negative.\nHe also achieved a sustained virological response to hepatitis C virus with Ledipasvir acetonate / Sofosbuvir 2 years ago. The patient’s medical history included surgery for appendicitis, the use of stents for acute myocardial infarction, transurethral resection of a tumor in the bladder, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, and osteoporosis. His medications included aspirin, losartan potassium, fenofibrate, benzbromarone, alendronate sodium hydrate, a proton pump inhibitor, and laxatives.\nThe patient’s blood pressure and pulse rate were stable, and mild anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] level, 9.8 g/dL) was observed during the first visit at our hospital; therefore, we assumed that the bleeding had stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for follow-up. The symptoms seemed to improve for a while, but 1 week later, the patient experienced abdominal pain. The preoperative blood test showed a decrease in the Hb level to 8.2 g/dL. Contrast-enhanced CT at the time of visit showed a retroperitoneal hematoma centered in the right paracolic gutter (Fig. A). A ring-shaped contrast area was observed between the hematoma and the ascending colon. As colonic diverticula were also present, bleeding from the extramural tumor or diverticula was considered. Although there was no obvious enlargement of the hematoma (Fig. B), abdominal pain recurred in a short time and anemia progressed. Based on the above, it was judged that the bleeding could not be controlled by follow-up, and surgery was decided upon. Preoperative liver function was as follows. Total protein 6.4 g/dL, Albumin 3.5 g/dL, Total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, Direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, Aspartate aminotransferase 33 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase 23 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 104 U/L, Cholinesterase 166 U/L, Lactate dehydrogenase 240 U/L. Tumor markers were not measured preoperatively.\nOn laparotomy, a small amount of bloody ascites was observed from the pelvis to the left lower abdomen, but no peritoneal dissemination lesion was detected. Strong adhesions were found on the right side of the abdomen; the removal of these adhesions resulted in a retroperitoneal hematoma. The cause of the bleeding and he location of the tumor could not be identified intraoperatively because of the extensive hematoma. A hemicolectomy was performed on the right side, because we judged from the preoperative CT that the hematoma and tumor could be resected together (Fig. ). The total time of the operation was 217 min and the blood loss was estimated at 505 mL.\nThe patient was diagnosed with moderately differentiated HCC of the ascending colon, located mainly within the subserosal and muscular layers, where a continuous retroperitoneal hematoma was observed.

        "patient": "A 53-year-old African American male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with complaints of headache, vision loss, brief twitching spells, and periodic unresponsiveness. Initial computed tomography (CT) imaging of the brain demonstrated a large hyperdense mass with intracranial and extracranial transcalvarial tumor extension (Figure ). Bone windows from the CT study reveal the involvement of the calvaria (Figure ). Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing left frontal mass traversing the frontal and parietal bones, intracranial involvement of the left frontal lobe, and extracranial involvement of the suprazygomatic masticator space and scalp (Figure ). The component deep to the inner table was associated with multiple peripheral flow voids (Figure ). Vasogenic edema in the left frontal lobe was noted along with midline shift, effacement of the left lateral ventricle, and left uncal herniation. Following a seven-day dexamethasone preparatory course, the patient was re-admitted for preoperative embolization followed by surgery on the following day.\nUnder conscious sedation, a 5 French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery, and a 5 French guiding catheter was advanced into the bilateral internal and external carotid arteries where digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed. DSA revealed vascular contributions to the tumor from the left middle cerebral, left middle meningeal, superficial temporal, anterior deep temporal, and middle deep temporal arteries (Figures -). Arteriovenous shunting was present upon angiography of the left external carotid artery. Though the middle cerebral artery branches could not be safely embolized, endovascular embolization was performed in the left middle meningeal artery at the level of the foramen spinosum, left anterior deep temporal artery, left middle deep temporal artery, and the distal anterior and proximal portions of the left superficial temporal artery using a combination of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles and gel foam torpedoes. Complete elimination of vascular supply from the left middle meningeal, left anterior deep temporal, and left middle deep temporal arteries along with near-complete elimination of contribution from the left superficial temporal artery was accomplished (Figure ). The patient remained stable throughout and was scheduled for surgery the following day.\nCraniotomy was performed under general anesthesia and visual inspection showed tumor involvement of the temporalis muscle. Frozen sections of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of meningioma. The tumor limits were outlined with the use of intraoperative navigation, and a burr hole was drilled away from the tumor margin in the parietal region. A craniectomy was performed into the temporal fossa, and the dura was opened and removed circumferentially. Microdissection was required to detach the middle cerebral artery from the tumor, and the tumor was subsequently circumscribed as vascular attachments were coagulated and divided. The middle cerebral artery branches were identified and preserved, and the tumor was removed with gross total resection followed by acrylic cranioplasty. The patient was returned to neuro-intensive care unit and experienced a postoperative seizure the day after the operation. Levetiracetam and lacosamide therapy was unable to adequately control the seizures and fosphenytoin was added, though multiple electroencephalograms (EEGs) were unable to identify clinical seizures or epileptiform changes. A postoperative CT of the head prior to discharge showed resolution of midline shift and resection of the hyperdense tumor with a small volume of expected postoperative blood products in the operative bed and stable frontal lobe vasogenic edema (Figure ).

Initial computed tomography (CT) imaging of the brain demonstrated a large hyperdense mass with intracranial and extracranial transcalvarial tumor extension (Figure ). Bone windows from the CT study reveal the involvement of the calvaria (Figure ). Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing left frontal mass traversing the frontal and parietal bones, intracranial involvement of the left frontal lobe, and extracranial involvement of the suprazygomatic masticator space and scalp (Figure ). The component deep to the inner table was associated with multiple peripheral flow voids (Figure ). Vasogenic edema in the left frontal lobe was noted along with midline shift, effacement of the left lateral ventricle, and left uncal herniation. Following a seven-day dexamethasone preparatory course, the patient was re-admitted for preoperative embolization followed by surgery on the following day.\nUnder conscious sedation, a 5 French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery, and a 5 French guiding catheter was advanced into the bilateral internal and external carotid arteries where digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed. DSA revealed vascular contributions to the tumor from the left middle cerebral, left middle meningeal, superficial temporal, anterior deep temporal, and middle deep temporal arteries (Figures -). Arteriovenous shunting was present upon angiography of the left external carotid artery. Though the middle cerebral artery branches could not be safely embolized, endovascular embolization was performed in the left middle meningeal artery at the level of the foramen spinosum, left anterior deep temporal artery, left middle deep temporal artery, and the distal anterior and proximal portions of the left superficial temporal artery using a combination of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles and gel foam torpedoes. Complete elimination of vascular supply from the left middle meningeal, left anterior deep temporal, and left middle deep temporal arteries along with near-complete elimination of contribution from the left superficial temporal artery was accomplished (Figure ). The patient remained stable throughout and was scheduled for surgery the following day.\nCraniotomy was performed under general anesthesia and visual inspection showed tumor involvement of the temporalis muscle. Frozen sections of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of meningioma. The tumor limits were outlined with the use of intraoperative navigation, and a burr hole was drilled away from the tumor margin in the parietal region. A craniectomy was performed into the temporal fossa, and the dura was opened and removed circumferentially. Microdissection was required to detach the middle cerebral artery from the tumor, and the tumor was subsequently circumscribed as vascular attachments were coagulated and divided. The middle cerebral artery branches were identified and preserved, and the tumor was removed with gross total resection followed by acrylic cranioplasty. The patient was returned to neuro-intensive care unit and experienced a postoperative seizure the day after the operation. Levetiracetam and lacosamide therapy was unable to adequately control the seizures and fosphenytoin was added, though multiple electroencephalograms (EEGs) were unable to identify clinical seizures or epileptiform changes. A postoperative CT of the head prior to discharge showed resolution of midline shift and resection of the hyperdense tumor with a small volume of expected postoperative blood products in the operative bed and stable frontal lobe vasogenic edema (Figure ). The pathology report confirmed the tumor to be a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II meningioma (atypical meningioma). The patient was later discharged on levetiracetam and fosphenytoin therapy as well as a dexamethasone taper, and upon discharge, the patient’s National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 0.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 19-year-old woman was admitted to our department with a chief complaint of left shoulder pain for 11 months. She had suffered a fall when skating 20 days earlier, leading to exacerbation of pain following activity. She was transferred from a local hospital, and the X-ray revealed a lytic destruction in her left proximal humerus with a suspected pathological fracture at the humeral neck. Chondrosarcoma was suspected on pathological diagnosis after fine-needle aspiration. However, she refused treatment at her local hospital and was transferred to our department for further treatment. There was a slight swelling over her left upper arm without any erythema. A slight activity restriction was detected on physical examination. Then, a shoulder–elbow belt was used to temporarily fix her affected arm.\nPlain radiographs in our hospital showed a lytic, expansible lesion with a sclerotic margin in the proximal humerus (). The following radiographic examinations including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scan were performed. CT images revealed there was predominantly lytic mixed with coarse trabeculation and densely sclerotic slight cortical destruction in the tumor (). MRI showed that the lesion presented low signals on T1-sequence, and mixed signals on T2-sequence, images with a slight enhancement (). An increased nuclear uptake at the destruction area was found on bone scan (). Cancer markers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, and CA199 were all normal. CT of chest indicated there was no lung metastasis.\nOpen biopsy was undertaken and pathological examination showed a spindle cell tumor of low-grade malignancy. Then, proximal humerus tumor en bloc resection followed by modular prosthetic replacement was carried out. The operation was performed with the patient under general anesthesia in a lateral position. The length of the tumor segment was 5.4 cm, and the resection length was 7.5 cm so that there was a 2 cm-tumor-negative margin (). The attachments of the latissimus dorsi and teres major on the humerus were severed to remove the tumor. The rotator cuff and axillary nerve were not affected by tumor. The bone defect present after tumor resection was reconstructed using a modular proximal humerus endoprosthesis (cement type; Chunglizhengda Medical Instruments Co., Beijing, People’s Republic of China). Then, the rotator cuff was sutured to the head of the prosthesis with 2–0 non-absorbable sutures (Ethibond* Excel, Polyester Suture, Green Braided, Johnson & Johnson, USA) to improve the stability of the shoulder joint. Muscles and soft tissues were reconstructed in situ. No mesh was used during the operation. The final pathological diagnosis was LGCOS with strong CDK4 and SMA positivity and focal mild MDM2 positivity on immumohistochemical staining (). The distal operated edge of the humerus was pathologically confirmed to be tumor negative. Olympus cellSens Entry (Version 510, OLYMPUS CORPORATION) was used to analysis the positive integrated optical density (IOD); the values of CDK4 was 0.32, SMA was 0.24, and MDM2 was 0.01, respectively.\nThe patient recovered well and was discharged 5 days after the surgery. She did not receive further chemotherapy and was closely followed-up postoperatively. Imaging studies were focused on tumor recurrence and the stability of the prosthetic implant. Up to the time of writing, 12 months after the surgery, the patient was capable of all activities of daily living needed for self-care and the MSTS (Musculoskeletal Tumor Society) score was 25.0. There were no signs of tumor recurrence and the positioning of the prosthetic remains good, with no dislocation, loosening, or fracture. Moreover, the follow-up is being continued.\nWritten informed consent with regard to publication of this case report and accompanying images was obtained from the patient.",

        "patient": "A 27-year-old woman admitted to the Emergency Department with right-sided lower abdominal pain that migrated from the umbilical region. She reported sharp, constant pain, exacerbated by movement, worsening over a few days. She has had previous episodes of the similar pain with no cause for symptoms found. Pregnancy test was negative and vital observations were normal.\nHer history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, polycystic ovaries, chronic pelvic pain, and secondary subfertility. She has one 4-year-old child, which was with spontaneous conception. Subsequently, difficulty in conceiving led to subfertility workup in the past, which involved baseline hormonal analysis, pelvic ultrasound scan, and hysterosalpingogram. On day 2, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were 4.3 IU/L and 12.1 IU/L, respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 1.7 mU/L, on day 21, progesterone was one confirming ovulation, and prolactin levels were 432 mIU/L. Pelvic ultrasound scan reported that uterus and left ovary were normal with absent right ovary. Hysterosalpingogram showed unicornuate uterus with patent salpinx on the left side []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was arranged which showed a normal renal tract bilaterally and a possibility of a supernumerary ovary on the right side. She also had ultrasound kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) and computed tomography (CT) KUB in the past to exclude renal cause of her pain, which had confirmed normal renal tract bilaterally. This finding led to diagnostic laparoscopy which confirmed unicornuate uterus with absent right fallopian tube and ovary. Supernumerary ovary was not found. The patient was commenced on clomiphene therapy as was desperate to conceive. On day 21, progesterone was arranged to monitor ovulation as per our unit protocol.\nExamination during this admission elicited right abdominal tenderness with no guarding or rigidity. Baseline investigations included full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urinalysis. White cell count was 6.8 × 109/L, CRP was 1.4 mg/L, and urinalysis was negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis was arranged, which showed no evidence of appendicitis, and a normal left ovary but right ovary was not visualized. This was consistent with ultrasound and laparoscopic findings in the past. The surgical review was sought to rule out appendicitis or other surgical causes. The surgical team reviewed the patient and requested CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which, to our surprise, reported bilateral ovaries present [] with no obvious surgical pathology.\nRepeated admissions for persisting pain and the inconsistency in radiology reports, regarding the status of her right ovary, instigated multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion, where all images, reports, and case notes were reviewed. The MDT reviewed the images and noted that the right ovary was indeed present but in the right paracolic gutter behind and underneath the ascending colon. The MDT felt that this maldescended or ectopic ovary could be the cause of her chronic right-sided pelvic pain and advised removal if the pain persisted. This was discussed with the patient, who wished to have it removed.\nFour-port laparoscopy was performed. The unicornuate uterus deviated to her left side with normal left tube and ovary visualized []. We opened the peritoneum over the sacral promonitory, and dissection continued over right common iliac vessels. Right ureter was identified. Cecum and ascending colon were mobilized and right ectopic ovary was found lying anterior to the psoas major muscle behind the ascending colon superior and lateral to the appendix.\nAttached to its distal end was the remnant of the fallopian tube (1–2 cm) with its fimbriae high up in the abdomen adhered to the parietal peritoneum and underlying bowel. A thin cord-like structure continued from this ovary over the iliac vessels to the cornual end of the right side of her uterus. The small “nodular” structure was also seen at the level of the external iliac vascular axis, which was considered to be a Müllerian remnant or a remnant of the lower gonadal cord. Maldescended ectopic ovary with remnant fimbrial end was dissected from the adjacent bowel [] and underlying psoas muscle using ultrasonic sheers. The ovarian vessels were coagulated safely using bipolar diathermy, and the entire ectopic ovary with its attached fimbrial end along with entire length of gubernaculum was removed. The operative time was 30 min, and the estimated blood loss was <5 ml.\nThe patient was pain-free following the surgery and was discharged home the following day. Histology confirmed features in keeping with an ectopic ovary. Eleven months later, the patient remains pain-free. She has conceived spontaneously and is 18 weeks gestation currently.",

        "patient": "A 77-year-old male presented with sore throat, cough, and low-grade fever on day 1. The following day, a positive nasopharyngeal PCR sample was obtained. Following admission to Tokyo Medical University Hospital, mild pneumonia was detected, which was treated with ciclesonide inhalation and favipiravir 200 mg per days for 14 days following dexamethasone 6.6 mg per day for 5 days, and insomnia and anxiety were treated with zolpidem, brotizolam, and quetiapine. He did not require oxygen therapy during the in-hospital clinical course, despite a prolonged fever for 10 days, and the patient was categorized as a mild COVID-19 case. Although he improved to normal respiratory function 21 days after admission and the treatment, the insomnia and anxiety symptoms remained. Before affecting COVID-19, he had never experienced anal restless and discomfort. However, several weeks after discharge, he gradually began to experience restless, deep anal discomfort, approximately 10 cm from the perineal region. This restless anal discomfort did not improve following defecation. Exercise such as walking or running and enthusiastically playing the television game made the symptoms relief, while taking a rest made the symptom worsen. Additionally, the symptom tended to be worsen in evening. The sleep was somehow kept by taking sleeping drugs. Colonoscopy revealed internal haemorrhoids without other rectal lesions. No other bladder or rectal disturbance or erectile dysfunction was confirmed. Neurological findings including deep tendon reflex, perineum loss of sensory and spinal cord injury, revealed no abnormalities. Serum iron level was not measured, while ferritin and haemoglobin revealed 688 ng/mL (normal range; 9.0–275 ng/mL) and 15.3 g/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine and Hb A1c were 0.93 mg/dL and 5.2%. Because he suffered in the anal region; urge to move, worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening without legs symptoms, we diagnosed the patient as restless anal syndrome as restless legs syndrome variant after COVID-19. The diagnosis was made by face-to-face interview and physical examination by internal medicine physician and psychiatrist familiar to RLS. Clonazepam treatment at 1.5 mg per day, which is a treatment option of restless leg syndrome recommended in guideline of Japanese society of neurological therapeutics, resulted in the alleviation of restless anal discomfort without administration of dopamine agonist. On 10 months after the treatment introduction, the symptom continues to alleviate. Family history of RLS and periodic limb movements were not observed.",

The following day, a positive nasopharyngeal PCR sample was obtained. Following admission to Tokyo Medical University Hospital, mild pneumonia was detected, which was treated with ciclesonide inhalation and favipiravir 200 mg per days for 14 days following dexamethasone 6.6 mg per day for 5 days, and insomnia and anxiety were treated with zolpidem, brotizolam, and quetiapine. He did not require oxygen therapy during the in-hospital clinical course, despite a prolonged fever for 10 days, and the patient was categorized as a mild COVID-19 case. Although he improved to normal respiratory function 21 days after admission and the treatment, the insomnia and anxiety symptoms remained. Before affecting COVID-19, he had never experienced anal restless and discomfort. However, several weeks after discharge, he gradually began to experience restless, deep anal discomfort, approximately 10 cm from the perineal region. This restless anal discomfort did not improve following defecation. Exercise such as walking or running and enthusiastically playing the television game made the symptoms relief, while taking a rest made the symptom worsen. Additionally, the symptom tended to be worsen in evening. The sleep was somehow kept by taking sleeping drugs. Colonoscopy revealed internal haemorrhoids without other rectal lesions. No other bladder or rectal disturbance or erectile dysfunction was confirmed. Neurological findings including deep tendon reflex, perineum loss of sensory and spinal cord injury, revealed no abnormalities. Serum iron level was not measured, while ferritin and haemoglobin revealed 688 ng/mL (normal range; 9.0–275 ng/mL) and 15.3 g/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine and Hb A1c were 0.93 mg/dL and 5.2%. Because he suffered in the anal region; urge to move, worsening with rest, improvement with exercise, and worsening at evening without legs symptoms, we diagnosed the patient as restless anal syndrome as restless legs syndrome variant after COVID-19. The diagnosis was made by face-to-face interview and physical examination by internal medicine physician and psychiatrist familiar to RLS. Clonazepam treatment at 1.5 mg per day, which is a treatment option of restless leg syndrome recommended in guideline of Japanese society of neurological therapeutics, resulted in the alleviation of restless anal discomfort without administration of dopamine agonist. On 10 months after the treatment introduction, the symptom continues to alleviate. Family history of RLS and periodic limb movements were not observed.''' \n\n output:"

The patient’s interstitial pneumonia, with minimal change in radiological findings was stable over the years, he complained no symptoms. He did not indicate exposure to fungus. Chest X-ray and CT scan obtained in December 2017 revealed high-attenuation mucus plug in right intermediate bronchial trunk, right pleural effusion (Fig. a), and infiltration in the right lung field (Fig. b).\nWe also found unilateral bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe.\nAdditionally, a slight fibrotic change along the pleural line reflecting interstitial pneumonia was observed. CT of paranasal sinuses obtained to investigate nasal congestion for 3 years, revealed high-attenuation mucus plug in the left ethmoid sinuses (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field. No wheezing and rhonchi were observed on auscultation.\nBlood tests showed a total leucocyte count of 9300/mm3 with 8% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 744/mm3) and elevated C-reactive protein. Radioimmunosorbent test revealed elevated IgE levels (1460 IU/ml), and the radioimmunosorbent test for specific IgE antibodies against Aspergillus, Penicillium and Candida were positive. Serum precipitins to Aspergillus were also positive.

        "title": "A “polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY)” diagnosed in an adult. Report of a case and review of the literature",
        "patient": "A 50-year-old lady, left handed, was referred to the department of neurological surgery, because of a drug-resistant epilepsy. She had a medical history, featured by the onset of seizures since early childhood. The patient was treated over several years with a combination of different anti-epileptic drugs, but she never obtained a complete control of seizures. During the past 2 years before admission, the patient experienced the worsening of crises. These were featured by mental confusion, reduced consciousness, dyskinesia in the upper right limb, and gaze deviation towards the right side. The crises occurred with a frequency of 3–4 episodes per day and occasionally had secondary generalization. She had also hypothyroidism. When the patient was hospitalized, neurological examination revealed moderate mental impairment with slowed speech and gait. Neuroradiological assessment was performed. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a densely calcified lesion involving left temporal lobe and insula []. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the presence of a hypointense (both in T1 and T2 sequences), nonenhancing lesion, surrounded by a hyperintense area detected by long-TR sequences []. The patient was scheduled for surgery.\nThe patient was positioned supine with the left shoulder elevated and head 60° rotated to the right side and fixed by radiolucent three-point Mayfield clamp. Preoperative CT scan with and without iodinate contrast was performed after positioning. Images of postpositioning CT scan were merged with preoperative MRI and used for neuronavigation. Motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials and direct monopolar and bipolar cortical and subcortical stimulation were used for neuromonitoring. The intraoperative imaging protocol used in the present case has been previously detailed.[,,] Under general anesthesia, a left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. Using intraoperative ultrasound (i-US) and neuronavigation, lesion was approached through a trans-sulcal approach transtemporal (T1-T2). i-US revealed a hyperechoic tumor and calcifications were clearly visible. Intraoperatively, lesion was distinguishable from normal white matter, albeit, in some areas, it appeared infiltrating. Calcifications were detected and resected. According to the institutional intraoperative protocol for intra-axial brain tumor, we also used 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence, but the tumor was not fluorescent. When resection was deemed complete, intraoperative CT (i-CT) was performed and a small calcification was detected. The images of i-CT scan were used for updated neuronavigation, which was useful to localize and resect the small calcified tumor remnant. Complete resection of the lesion was achieved as confirmed by last i-US acquisition and final i-CT. Neuromonitoring did not document any variation of during all surgical procedure.\nPostoperative MRI confirmed the radical resection of the lesion []. Postoperative course was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged on the 6th postoperative day, without any neurological deficit. The frequency and intensity of crises eventually decreased, but the pharmacological therapy was not modified, as electroencephalographic alterations still persisted also during follow-up.\nGrossly, the tumor sample consisted of multiple fragments, markedly hard in consistency, measuring 2 cm in aggregate diameter. Histologic examination showed an extensively calcified and hypocellular lesion [], mainly composed of abundant calcifications, ranging from small calcospherules to larger and confluent psammomatous bodies, intermingled with a much smaller component of bland looking, small and roundish oligodendroglioma-like neoplastic cells [], showing small rounded nuclei, perinuclear halos and arranged in an infiltrative manner; in addition, tumor exhibited a less represented, spindled, astrocytic-like component []. Some neoplastic cells were vaguely distributed around capillary blood vessels, resulting in a focal formation of perivascular pseudorosette-like structures. No Rosenthal fibers or eosinophilic granular bodies were found. Neither necrosis, nor mitoses, nor microvascular proliferation was identified. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely stained with CD34 [], glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), and retained the α-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation syndrome (ATRX) nuclear expression. No immunohistochemical staining was obtained with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-R132H, synaptophysin, chromogranin-A, epithelial membrane antigen, neuronal nuclear antigen (Neu-N), and BRAF-V600E. Ki-67 proliferation index was unremarkable (<1%). Molecular analyses showed absence of IDH1/IDH2 and BRAF mutations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for 1p/19q codeletion was negative.

She had a medical history, featured by the onset of seizures since early childhood. The patient was treated over several years with a combination of different anti-epileptic drugs, but she never obtained a complete control of seizures. During the past 2 years before admission, the patient experienced the worsening of crises. These were featured by mental confusion, reduced consciousness, dyskinesia in the upper right limb, and gaze deviation towards the right side. The crises occurred with a frequency of 3–4 episodes per day and occasionally had secondary generalization. She had also hypothyroidism. When the patient was hospitalized, neurological examination revealed moderate mental impairment with slowed speech and gait. Neuroradiological assessment was performed. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a densely calcified lesion involving left temporal lobe and insula []. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the presence of a hypointense (both in T1 and T2 sequences), nonenhancing lesion, surrounded by a hyperintense area detected by long-TR sequences []. The patient was scheduled for surgery.\nThe patient was positioned supine with the left shoulder elevated and head 60° rotated to the right side and fixed by radiolucent three-point Mayfield clamp. Preoperative CT scan with and without iodinate contrast was performed after positioning. Images of postpositioning CT scan were merged with preoperative MRI and used for neuronavigation. Motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials and direct monopolar and bipolar cortical and subcortical stimulation were used for neuromonitoring. The intraoperative imaging protocol used in the present case has been previously detailed.[,,] Under general anesthesia, a left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. Using intraoperative ultrasound (i-US) and neuronavigation, lesion was approached through a trans-sulcal approach transtemporal (T1-T2). i-US revealed a hyperechoic tumor and calcifications were clearly visible. Intraoperatively, lesion was distinguishable from normal white matter, albeit, in some areas, it appeared infiltrating. Calcifications were detected and resected. According to the institutional intraoperative protocol for intra-axial brain tumor, we also used 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence, but the tumor was not fluorescent.

He did not have any high-risk markers, with CD38 negative disease that showed del 13q on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and normal beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). He remained asymptomatic and under observation for several years but was noted to have rapidly increasing lymphocytosis, progressive lymphadenopathy, symptomatic splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in 2015 ( and ). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow with diffuse involvement by lambda light chain-restricted small lymphocytes occupying 95% of the marrow space. First-line treatment was planned with obinutuzumab (1000 mg) and chlorambucil as per standard guidelines but the patient never started chlorambucil due initially to a concern of tumor lysis syndrome from significant disease burden, and later due to development of prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia on obinutuzumab alone. The dose of obinutuzumab was reduced by 20% for cycle 4 and he was given daily G-CSF for three days after the obinutuzumab dose for that cycle only. After completion of six planned cycles of single-agent obinutuzumab, the patient achieved partial response (PR) to therapy as measured by greater than 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and splenomegaly as well as a platelet level greater than 100 × 109/L, as per iwCLL guidelines. Disease was detectable as minimal residual disease (MRD) only, by CLL specific MRD peripheral flow cytometry 0.37%, 2 months after completion of treatment, without residual blood, spleen or lymphadenopathy detected. His CLL remained stable over the next 2 years with only slight increase in lymphocytosis. Approximately two-and-a-half years after initial treatment, thrombocytopenia and rapid increase in lymphocytosis were noted ( and ).\nA repeat flow cytometry confirmed monoclonal B-cell population along with an upward trending ALC, confirming disease relapse. A repeat FISH once again showed a 13q deletion. Retreatment was initiated due to worsening fatigue and concern for infections as Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was trending downward. After discussing several treatment options, a shared decision of reintroducing obinutuzumab was taken based on the prolonged initial response of over 2 years with this as a single agent. Lymphocyte count normalized after only one cycle of retreatment and the patient eventually achieved partial response again per the same iwCLL guidelines. Grade 2 IRR was noted at initial treatment but not at retreatment while grade 2 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were noted at initial as well as retreatment with obinutuzumab.

During clinical examinations, pale mucous membrane, tachycardia, tachypnea and distention of the bladder, probably due to compression of the urethra by the mass were detected. After stabilization of the patient the mass was removed surgically and concurrent ovariohysterectomy was also performed. On gross examination, the healthy tissue of the right ovary was totally replaced by a tumor like mass. The mass was brown, homogeneous, firm and elastic at palpation. It was well-circumscribed, nodular and clearly demarcated from the healthy ovary.\nThe appropriate tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections of 5 µm thicknesses were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and studied by a compound light microscope. Serial sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with primary monoclonal antibodies specific for pancyto-keratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100, inhibin, calretinin, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin and vimentin. All primary anti-bodies were from Novocastra Laboratories (Newcastle, UK). Labelling was detected with an avidin-biotin conjugate (ABC) procedure.\nHistological examination revealed presence of the solid sheets and acinar structures composed of polyhedral to elongated cells. Broad bands of fibrovascular stroma divided the encapsulated neoplastic mass into lobules of different sizes and shapes. The neoplastic cells had large, eosinophilic, and vacuolated cytoplasms and round to oval nuclei containing small nucleoli (). The single or multiple clear vacuoles were of different sizes and optically empty ().\nIn some parts of the tumor, angiogenesis was prominent which at some instances resulted in small hemorrhagic foci. The neoplastic cells labelled cytoplasmic positivity for vimentin (), but did not express any other marker. These immunohistochemical findings allowed confirming the diagnosis of Leydig cells tumor.",

Serial sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with primary monoclonal antibodies specific for pancyto-keratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100, inhibin, calretinin, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin and vimentin. All primary anti-bodies were from Novocastra Laboratories (Newcastle, UK). Labelling was detected with an avidin-biotin conjugate (ABC) procedure.\nHistological examination revealed presence of the solid sheets and acinar structures composed of polyhedral to elongated cells. Broad bands of fibrovascular stroma divided the encapsulated neoplastic mass into lobules of different sizes and shapes. The neoplastic cells had large, eosinophilic, and vacuolated cytoplasms and round to oval nuclei containing small nucleoli (). The single or multiple clear vacuoles were of different sizes and optically empty ().\nIn some parts of the tumor, angiogenesis was prominent which at some instances resulted in small hemorrhagic foci. The neoplastic cells labelled cytoplasmic positivity for vimentin (), but did not express any other marker. These immunohistochemical findings allowed confirming the diagnosis of Leydig cells tumor.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 32-year-old female with no known past medical history, no recent travel, working as a home aid, presented to our emergency department at the end of January 2020, with intermittent fevers, generalized body aches, non-productive cough, congestion, and nausea for four days. She was found to be positive for Influenza B by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After a few hours of monitoring in the ED, she was noted to tolerate oral intake, had stable vital signs, and was subsequently discharged home. However, she returned to the ED the next day with worsening symptoms. She reported that although her cough had subsided, she continued having worsening myalgia and developed new epigastric pain, orthopnea, and foul-smelling urine. She denied chest pain, palpitations, lower extremity edema, or vomiting at the time. Upon presentation to the ED, she was found to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure (BP) in the 80’s, tachycardic with an initial heart rate (HR) of 180 bpm, and afebrile. Her hemodynamic status improved after she received 1 L of Ringer’s lactate; BP increased to 90s/60s, HR decreased to 120s. Her initial physical examination was notable only for decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases. Her cardiac sounds were clear and regular without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and no jugular vein distention (JVD) was noted. The remaining physical examination including abdominal, neurological, and musculoskeletal was unremarkable. Initial lab work revealed no leukocytosis, anemia, or electrolyte abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes were negative; however, lactate was elevated to 4.2 mmol/L. Urinalysis showed moderate proteinuria, positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and elevated white blood cell count (WBC) concerning urinary tract infection. Chest X-ray revealed mild prominence of the right mediastinal contour at the area of the superior vena cava (SVC). Her initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with decreased QRS voltage (Figure ).\nPoint of care ultrasound (POCUS) showed moderate pericardial effusion with signs of right atrial (RA; Figure ) and right ventricular (RV; Figure ) diastolic collapse along with increased inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter without respirophasic variation (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and a subsequent formal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of tamponade physiology. The patient underwent emergent pericardiocentesis in the catheterization laboratory where 250 cc yellow-colored pericardial fluid was removed with immediate symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement. A pericardial drain was placed and collected a total of an additional 450 ccs in the next 72 hours. After removal of the pericardial drain on the fourth day of admission, a repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) confirmed no re-accumulation of pericardial fluid with the restoration of normal contractile physiology.\nThe patient also received a five-day course of Oseltamivir and a three-day course of antibiotics for urinary tract infection (urine culture grew pansensitive Escherichia coli, blood cultures remained negative) during her hospital stay. By the fifth day of admission, the patient reported feeling back to baseline, asymptomatic, without any evidence of residual pericardial effusion and was, therefore, discharged home.",

        "patient": "A 29-year-old man presented with arthralgia, pain and paresthesia in fingers. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gross hematuria or photosensitivity were absent. There was no family history of Fabry Disease. Upon physical examination, he was normotensive and there were no signs of arthritis or edema. Laboratory tests showed: BUN: 10 mg/dl (reference range: 8–24 mg/dl); serum creatinine: 0.8 mg/dl (reference range: 0.5–1.2 mg/dl); estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measured using CKD-EPI equation: 120 ml/min/1.73m2 (reference range: > 90 ml/min/1.73m2); 24-h proteinuria: 1.9 g (reference range: no proteinuria); urine examination without hematuria or leukocyturia; normal serum complement and normal serum protein electrophoresis. Investigations for other causes of proteinuria were negative. Renal ultrasound was normal. Given these findings, treatment with Enalapril (5 mg/day) was initiated. The patient continued to report pain in the right ankle associated with pain and paresthesia in hands. Diagnosis of FD was suggested. Examination revealed cornea verticillata and angiokeratomas on the back. Echocardiogram showed endocardial border binary appearance and posterior mitral leaflet prolapse, with left ventricular wall thickness of 0.8 cm (normal range: 0,7–1.2 cm), left ventricular mass of 65 g/m2 (normal range: 57-75 g/m2) and no signal of systolic nor diastolic dysfunction.

        "title": "Complete response of extramedullary relapse in breast of acute T lymphoblastic leukemia after bone marrow transplantation to chemoradiotherapy: a case report and literature review",
        "patient": "In December 2013, a 32-year-old Chinese woman presented with a 1-month history of intermittent fever. Her family, psychosocial and past history was unremarkable. On physical examination, pallor was significant. Neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly could be detected. The complete blood cell count examination demonstrated significantly increased leukocyte (125 × 109 /L) and decreased hemoglobin (71 g/L) and platelet (17 × 109 /L) values. The subsequent peripheral blood smears and bone marrow aspirate showed blast cell infiltration of 91 and 89.5 %, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow aspirate revealed that the blast cells (P9) accounted for 91.50 % of the cell population, which predominantly expressed CD34, CD7, CD33, CD38dim, and HLA-DR; partly expressed cCD3; seldom expressed cMPO, CD56, and CD13; and did not express CD117, cCD79a, CD10, CD19, CD2, CD3, CD99, CD123, CD11b, CD15, CD14, CD64, CD4, CD11c, CD25, CD36, CXCR4, cTdT, CD5, CD57, CD1a, and CD8 (Fig. ). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with ATLL with myeloid antigen expression. Fusion gene screening revealed SET-CAN positivity. Induction chemotherapy using a VDCLP (vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, L-asparaginase and prednisone) regimen failed to achieve remission. The treatment was switched to a CAM (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine and 6-mercaptopurine) regimen, which induced complete remission (CR). Consolidation chemotherapy including one cycle of CAM and two cycles of HD-MTX (high dose methotrexate) was administered during which intrathecal chemotherapy was provided 12 times.\nIn May 2014, the patient received allogeneic HSCT from her human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sister. The conditioning regimen administered was modified BU/CY (busulfan/cyclophosphamide). CSA (cyclosporin), CellCept, and short-term methotrexate (MTX) were used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We administered an infusion of 3.2 × 106/kg CD34+ cells and 11.26 × 108/kg mononuclear cells. Megakaryocyte and granulocyte engraftment occurred at day +9 and +13, respectively. Bone marrow evaluation at day +14, +28, +42, +60, +90 indicated CR. Additionally, flow cytometry did not indicate minimal residual disease. The patient had 100 % donor chimerism. After HSCT, 4 cycles of intrathecal chemotherapy were conducted and cerebrospinal fluid examination results were unremarkable. The post-transplant course was uneventful, without GVHD.\nSix months after HSCT, the patient complained of a hard lump in the inner upper quadrant of the right breast. A subsequent breast ultrasound demonstrated two masses in her right breast. The larger one, located in the inner upper quadrant, measured approximately 35 mm × 26 mm × 10 mm with high vascularity and a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 4. The smaller one, a 9 mm × 4.3 mm hypoechoic nodule, was located at a 9 o’clock position. The biopsy of the large lump indicated the presence of a small round cell tumor (Fig. ) with an immunohistochemistry profile similar to that of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: CD20 (-), CD3 (+), CD56 (+), CK (-), P63 (-), Syn (-), TTF-1 (-), and Ki-67 (+60 %). Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation revealed no evidence of leukemia. SET-CAN expression was negative. Therefore, a diagnosis of breast IEMR was established. After two cycles of chemotherapy with nelarabine (1500 mg/m2, 2310 mg d1, 3, 5, q28d) and one cycle of chemotherapy with VCP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) -VP (vincristine, and prednisone) -VCP -VP, the large lump shrank to 15.6 mm × 5.5 mm. However, the small nodule showed no changes and caused pain. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated a moderately FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) -avid nodule (standardized uptake value: 4.6) in the outer upper quadrant of the right breast and no focal uptake in the other sites (Fig. ). Subsequently, the patient underwent simple intensity-modulated radiotherapy (sIMRT). The whole right breast received a dose of 40 Gy/2 Gy/20 f with a concurrent dose of 50 Gy/2.5 Gy/20 f (Fig. ) to the FDG -avid lump in the outer upper quadrant. The dose volume histogram showed excellent dose coverage to the target volume and minimal dose to the surrounding normal tissue (Fig. ). After irradiation of 14 f, the patient did not experience pain, and the lump in the outer upper quadrant disappeared. Furthermore, intensive evaluation of the bone marrow including cytologic, flow cytometry, and molecular examination revealed CR. The post-radiotherapy breast ultrasound also confirmed that the FDG -avid lump disappeared. Thus, radiotherapy resulted in CR with mild related side effects. Thereafter, the patient received four cycles of chemotherapy with decitabine (25 mg d1-5, q28d). The last evaluation of the bone marrow, conducted 18 months after HSCT, indicated CR (Fig. ). The breast ultrasound conducted on April, 2016, 1 year after radiotherapy, still demonstrated CR.",

Her family, psychosocial and past history was unremarkable. On physical examination, pallor was significant. Neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly could be detected. The complete blood cell count examination demonstrated significantly increased leukocyte (125 × 109 /L) and decreased hemoglobin (71 g/L) and platelet (17 × 109 /L) values. The subsequent peripheral blood smears and bone marrow aspirate showed blast cell infiltration of 91 and 89.5 %, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow aspirate revealed that the blast cells (P9) accounted for 91.50 % of the cell population, which predominantly expressed CD34, CD7, CD33, CD38dim, and HLA-DR; partly expressed cCD3; seldom expressed cMPO, CD56, and CD13; and did not express CD117, cCD79a, CD10, CD19, CD2, CD3, CD99, CD123, CD11b, CD15, CD14, CD64, CD4, CD11c, CD25, CD36, CXCR4, cTdT, CD5, CD57, CD1a, and CD8 (Fig. ). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with ATLL with myeloid antigen expression. Fusion gene screening revealed SET-CAN positivity. Induction chemotherapy using a VDCLP (vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, L-asparaginase and prednisone) regimen failed to achieve remission. The treatment was switched to a CAM (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine and 6-mercaptopurine) regimen, which induced complete remission (CR). Consolidation chemotherapy including one cycle of CAM and two cycles of HD-MTX (high dose methotrexate) was administered during which intrathecal chemotherapy was provided 12 times.\nIn May 2014, the patient received allogeneic HSCT from her human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sister. The conditioning regimen administered was modified BU/CY (busulfan/cyclophosphamide). CSA (cyclosporin), CellCept, and short-term methotrexate (MTX) were used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We administered an infusion of 3.2 × 106/kg CD34+ cells and 11.26 × 108/kg mononuclear cells. Megakaryocyte and granulocyte engraftment occurred at day +9 and +13, respectively. Bone marrow evaluation at day +14, +28, +42, +60, +90 indicated CR. Additionally, flow cytometry did not indicate minimal residual disease. The patient had 100 % donor chimerism. After HSCT, 4 cycles of intrathecal chemotherapy were conducted and cerebrospinal fluid examination results were unremarkable. The post-transplant course was uneventful, without GVHD.\nSix months after HSCT, the patient complained of a hard lump in the inner upper quadrant of the right breast. A subsequent breast ultrasound demonstrated two masses in her right breast. The larger one, located in the inner upper quadrant, measured approximately 35 mm × 26 mm × 10 mm with high vascularity and a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 4. The smaller one, a 9 mm × 4.3 mm hypoechoic nodule, was located at a 9 o’clock position. The biopsy of the large lump indicated the presence of a small round cell tumor (Fig. ) with an immunohistochemistry profile similar to that of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: CD20 (-), CD3 (+), CD56 (+), CK (-), P63 (-), Syn (-), TTF-1 (-), and Ki-67 (+60 %). Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation revealed no evidence of leukemia. SET-CAN expression was negative. Therefore, a diagnosis of breast IEMR was established. After two cycles of chemotherapy with nelarabine (1500 mg/m2, 2310 mg d1, 3, 5, q28d) and one cycle of chemotherapy with VCP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) -VP (vincristine, and prednisone) -VCP -VP, the large lump shrank to 15.6 mm × 5.5 mm. However, the small nodule showed no changes and caused pain. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated a moderately FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) -avid nodule (standardized uptake value: 4.6) in the outer upper quadrant of the right breast and no focal uptake in the other sites (Fig. ). Subsequently, the patient underwent simple intensity-modulated radiotherapy (sIMRT). The whole right breast received a dose of 40 Gy/2 Gy/20 f with a concurrent dose of 50 Gy/2.5 Gy/20 f (Fig. ) to the FDG -avid lump in the outer upper quadrant. The dose volume histogram showed excellent dose coverage to the target volume and minimal dose to the surrounding normal tissue (Fig. ). After irradiation of 14 f, the patient did not experience pain, and the lump in the outer upper quadrant disappeared. Furthermore, intensive evaluation of the bone marrow including cytologic, flow cytometry, and molecular examination revealed CR. The post-radiotherapy breast ultrasound also confirmed that the FDG -avid lump disappeared. Thus, radiotherapy resulted in CR with mild related side effects. Thereafter, the patient received four cycles of chemotherapy with decitabine (25 mg d1-5, q28d). The last evaluation of the bone marrow, conducted 18 months after HSCT, indicated CR (Fig. ). The breast ultrasound conducted on April, 2016, 1 year after radiotherapy, still demonstrated CR.''' \n\n output:"

        "title": "Co-infection with Anaplasma platys, Bartonella henselae and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum in a veterinarian",
        "patient": "Prior to the onset of her symptoms, a 27-year-old female veterinarian had been actively involved in hospital-based work treating domestic animals, primarily cats and dogs, and anatomical research dissecting wild animals (including lions, giraffe, rabbits, mongoose, and other animals). These activities had occurred in Grenada, Ireland and South Africa. The woman reported contact with fleas, ticks, lice, biting flies, mosquitoes, spiders and mites. She also reported scratches or bites by dogs, cats, birds, horses, reptiles, rabbits and rodents. Beginning in September, 2010, headaches of approximately two weeks duration preceded a fainting episode, photophobia, generalized muscle fasciculations and the onset of tonic-clonic seizures. When hospitalized in South Africa, a CBC and serum chemistry profile were unremarkable and a contrast brain CT revealed no structural abnormalities or evidence of vascular damage. A few days later, encephalitis was diagnosed based on MRI lesions that were considered characteristic for Herpes simplex encephalitis. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and over the next 10 days was maintained on a sedative, lorazepam (Ativan), anticonvulsants including sodium valproate (Epilim) and phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) which was stopped after an adverse reaction, and pain medications including tramadol hydrochloride (Ultram ER) and paracetamol (Perfalgan), as required. Amoxicillin, cephazolin and doxycycline were also administered for 2 weeks. A 24 hour electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed no electrical abnormalities and CSF analysis was not indicative of inflammation or infection. Electron microscopy of CSF revealed protein fibrils suspected to be associated with “tick-bite fever”. Due to the potential of a transmissible infectious agent, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa tested for Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebolavirus), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), spotted fever group rickettsioses (Rickettsia africae and Rickettsia conorii), Rift Valley Fever (Phlebovirus), Equine Viral Encephalitis (Arbovirus), African horse sickness (Orbivirus) and Rabies(Lyssavirus), all of which were negative. The patient was also treated presumptively because of potential Streptococcus suis exposure, as she had case contact a few days prior to hospitalization with a piglet that had cerebral signs and a positive brain culture. When discharged from ICU to the ward, she was treated with sodium valproate and carbamazepine (Tegretol). One month post-discharge, the patient continued to experience tremors, mild seizures, ataxia and memory loss and had left-sided weakness. An analgesic containing paracentamol, codeine phosphate, caffeine, and meprobmate (STILPNE® Capsules) was added to the treatment regimen. During the next two weeks seizure frequency, severity, and duration increased, with seizures becoming more violent and lasting at least 10 minutes. When referred to a neurologist, the patient was monitored on the neurology ward using a three-day camera linked to an EEG, which documented seizures occurring four to seven times a day. As seizures accompanied ringing noises (drip alarms, jiggling bottles on trolleys, etc.), anticonvulsants were discontinued on the premise that seizures were induced by sound hyper-sensitivity and were potentially being accentuated by the medications. Sertraline hydrochloride, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was administered for noise hypersensitivity, post-encephalitic depression, disorientation, and irritability. Results of repeat CBC, serum chemistry panel, EEG and MRI were negative or within reference ranges. The neurologist concluded that the lesion(s) inducing the seizure focus was/were microscopic and deeper than detectable by EEG. While hospitalized, a psychologist recommended further personal counseling, as he felt that the patient needed to come to terms with post-encephalitic seizures and inability to be active and to live the life she experienced before becoming ill. Before the onset of symptoms, the woman was actively involved in windsurfing, diving, surfing, running and sailing and had completed the Dublin marathon less than a year before the onset of her illness.\nOne month later, headaches continued, migraines were diagnosed, and vertigo had developed especially when in a moving vehicle, however the left sided weakness had improved and repeat memory testing documented substantial improvement in short term memory with residual deficits in math skills. Amitriptyline (Elavil) and clonazepam (Rivotril) were administered for treatment of the migraines and anxiety, respectively. By four months after the onset of illness, the patient associated her seizures with loud noises, bright light or long car rides, all of which she attempted to avoid. One month later, she was again hospitalized due to severe migraines, inability to enunciate words and left-sided weakness. A CBC, serum chemistry panel, and a CT scan were negative or within reference ranges. Sodium valproate was restarted after consultation with a second neurologist. A combination drug containing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Tramacet) were added to the treatment regimen for the migraines. When discharged five days later, amitriptyline, sodium valproate, sertraline hydrochloride and Tramacet were continued until August, 2011, at which time the patient elected to discontinue medications against medical advice. One week later, she was hospitalized for debilitating migraines, which persisted for seven days despite administration of multiple medications. Again, there were no MRI abnormalities. She was discharged by her neurologist with instructions to take clobazam (Urbanol), agomelatine (Valdoxin) and amitriptyline for depression and management of the noise hypersensitivity, Tramadol for headaches, and topiramate 100 mg bid (Topamax) as an anticonvulsant and lorazepam (Ativan SL) for emergency seizure control. Between September 2011 and January 2012, these medications were continued and the patient experienced remarkable improvement, with decreased sensitivity to flashing lights, increased tolerance to loud noises, increased energy and improved mental capacities. However in November 2011, she was admitted to the emergency room following the development of joint pain, particularly severe in the knees, left wrist, right elbow and lower back. Standard view radiographs of her left wrist, which was the most severely affected source of pain, revealed no structural abnormalities, CBC values were within reference ranges and an ANA panel, uric acid level and Rheumatoid Factor assay were negative. Initial treatment included intravenously administered dexamethasone, followed by oral steroid maintenance therapy for five days, and Etoricoxib (Arcoxia) 90 mg bid for two weeks. Joint and back pain abated after two weeks.\nWhile in transit from South Africa to Grenada in December 2011, the patient had a seizure in JFK airport in New York, after which she continued to experience severe tonic-clonic seizures while in Grenada. When examined by a neurologist on January 6, 2012, there was a mildly abnormal EEG pattern characterized by bilateral sharp activity, and interpreted as consistent with cerebral irritability in a patient receiving anticonvulsant therapy. Medications now included topiramate (200 mg bid), lamotragine (Lamictal), clonazepam, amitriptyline, agomelatine (Valdoxane) and Tramadol as needed. Over the next two months the seizures decreased in frequency and severity. Concurrently, the woman’s migraines increased in frequency and duration, often lasting 5 days. On March 1st, the patient was airlifted from Grenada to Trinidad in status epilepticus. She remained hospitalized until March 8th, during which time therapy targeted seizures and migraines, but would not have addressed an underlying infection. After discharge, the migraines continued, requiring periodic administration of buprenorphine (Temgesic), which rapidly stopped the migraine within minutes of administration.\nTwenty months after the onset of the patient’s illness, one of the authors visited St George’s University to participate in a research collaboration involving canine ehrlichiosis, which is a highly endemic canine tick borne disease on the island of Grenada. After reciting her medical history during a casual conversation, the woman elected to enter an ongoing study regarding Bartonella spp. infection in high risk patients, i.e. veterinary professionals (North Carolina State University Institutional Review Board approval IRB 1960–11). Written permission was given to also test for other vector borne organisms.",

        "prompt": "according to the history given bellow, please extract the diagnosis of the patient from the orginal text and give a standard diagnosis name. \n\nfor example: patient's history:'''omitted here''' \n\noutput: {\"originalText\": \"blood cultures returned positive for Gram-positive bacilli, subsequently identified as B cereus\", \"standardDiagnosis\": \"Bacillus cereus Bacteremia\"} \n\n here is a patient's history:'''Prior to the onset of her symptoms, a 27-year-old female veterinarian had been actively involved in hospital-based work treating domestic animals, primarily cats and dogs, and anatomical research dissecting wild animals (including lions, giraffe, rabbits, mongoose, and other animals). These activities had occurred in Grenada, Ireland and South Africa. The woman reported contact with fleas, ticks, lice, biting flies, mosquitoes, spiders and mites. She also reported scratches or bites by dogs, cats, birds, horses, reptiles, rabbits and rodents. Beginning in September, 2010, headaches of approximately two weeks duration preceded a fainting episode, photophobia, generalized muscle fasciculations and the onset of tonic-clonic seizures. When hospitalized in South Africa, a CBC and serum chemistry profile were unremarkable and a contrast brain CT revealed no structural abnormalities or evidence of vascular damage. A few days later, encephalitis was diagnosed based on MRI lesions that were considered characteristic for Herpes simplex encephalitis. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and over the next 10 days was maintained on a sedative, lorazepam (Ativan), anticonvulsants including sodium valproate (Epilim) and phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) which was stopped after an adverse reaction, and pain medications including tramadol hydrochloride (Ultram ER) and paracetamol (Perfalgan), as required. Amoxicillin, cephazolin and doxycycline were also administered for 2 weeks. A 24 hour electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed no electrical abnormalities and CSF analysis was not indicative of inflammation or infection. Electron microscopy of CSF revealed protein fibrils suspected to be associated with “tick-bite fever”. Due to the potential of a transmissible infectious agent, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa tested for Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebolavirus), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), spotted fever group rickettsioses (Rickettsia africae and Rickettsia conorii), Rift Valley Fever (Phlebovirus), Equine Viral Encephalitis (Arbovirus), African horse sickness (Orbivirus) and Rabies(Lyssavirus), all of which were negative. The patient was also treated presumptively because of potential Streptococcus suis exposure, as she had case contact a few days prior to hospitalization with a piglet that had cerebral signs and a positive brain culture. When discharged from ICU to the ward, she was treated with sodium valproate and carbamazepine (Tegretol). One month post-discharge, the patient continued to experience tremors, mild seizures, ataxia and memory loss and had left-sided weakness. An analgesic containing paracentamol, codeine phosphate, caffeine, and meprobmate (STILPNE® Capsules) was added to the treatment regimen. During the next two weeks seizure frequency, severity, and duration increased, with seizures becoming more violent and lasting at least 10 minutes. When referred to a neurologist, the patient was monitored on the neurology ward using a three-day camera linked to an EEG, which documented seizures occurring four to seven times a day. As seizures accompanied ringing noises (drip alarms, jiggling bottles on trolleys, etc.), anticonvulsants were discontinued on the premise that seizures were induced by sound hyper-sensitivity and were potentially being accentuated by the medications. Sertraline hydrochloride, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was administered for noise hypersensitivity, post-encephalitic depression, disorientation, and irritability. Results of repeat CBC, serum chemistry panel, EEG and MRI were negative or within reference ranges. The neurologist concluded that the lesion(s) inducing the seizure focus was/were microscopic and deeper than detectable by EEG. While hospitalized, a psychologist recommended further personal counseling, as he felt that the patient needed to come to terms with post-encephalitic seizures and inability to be active and to live the life she experienced before becoming ill. Before the onset of symptoms, the woman was actively involved in windsurfing, diving, surfing, running and sailing and had completed the Dublin marathon less than a year before the onset of her illness.\nOne month later, headaches continued, migraines were diagnosed, and vertigo had developed especially when in a moving vehicle, however the left sided weakness had improved and repeat memory testing documented substantial improvement in short term memory with residual deficits in math skills. Amitriptyline (Elavil) and clonazepam (Rivotril) were administered for treatment of the migraines and anxiety, respectively. By four months after the onset of illness, the patient associated her seizures with loud noises, bright light or long car rides, all of which she attempted to avoid. One month later, she was again hospitalized due to severe migraines, inability to enunciate words and left-sided weakness. A CBC, serum chemistry panel, and a CT scan were negative or within reference ranges. Sodium valproate was restarted after consultation with a second neurologist. A combination drug containing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Tramacet) were added to the treatment regimen for the migraines. When discharged five days later, amitriptyline, sodium valproate, sertraline hydrochloride and Tramacet were continued until August, 2011, at which time the patient elected to discontinue medications against medical advice. One week later, she was hospitalized for debilitating migraines, which persisted for seven days despite administration of multiple medications. Again, there were no MRI abnormalities. She was discharged by her neurologist with instructions to take clobazam (Urbanol), agomelatine (Valdoxin) and amitriptyline for depression and management of the noise hypersensitivity, Tramadol for headaches, and topiramate 100 mg bid (Topamax) as an anticonvulsant and lorazepam (Ativan SL) for emergency seizure control. Between September 2011 and January 2012, these medications were continued and the patient experienced remarkable improvement, with decreased sensitivity to flashing lights, increased tolerance to loud noises, increased energy and improved mental capacities. However in November 2011, she was admitted to the emergency room following the development of joint pain, particularly severe in the knees, left wrist, right elbow and lower back. Standard view radiographs of her left wrist, which was the most severely affected source of pain, revealed no structural abnormalities, CBC values were within reference ranges and an ANA panel, uric acid level and Rheumatoid Factor assay were negative. Initial treatment included intravenously administered dexamethasone, followed by oral steroid maintenance therapy for five days, and Etoricoxib (Arcoxia) 90 mg bid for two weeks. Joint and back pain abated after two weeks.\nWhile in transit from South Africa to Grenada in December 2011, the patient had a seizure in JFK airport in New York, after which she continued to experience severe tonic-clonic seizures while in Grenada. When examined by a neurologist on January 6, 2012, there was a mildly abnormal EEG pattern characterized by bilateral sharp activity, and interpreted as consistent with cerebral irritability in a patient receiving anticonvulsant therapy. Medications now included topiramate (200 mg bid), lamotragine (Lamictal), clonazepam, amitriptyline, agomelatine (Valdoxane) and Tramadol as needed. Over the next two months the seizures decreased in frequency and severity. Concurrently, the woman’s migraines increased in frequency and duration, often lasting 5 days. On March 1st, the patient was airlifted from Grenada to Trinidad in status epilepticus. She remained hospitalized until March 8th, during which time therapy targeted seizures and migraines, but would not have addressed an underlying infection. After discharge, the migraines continued, requiring periodic administration of buprenorphine (Temgesic), which rapidly stopped the migraine within minutes of administration.\nTwenty months after the onset of the patient’s illness, one of the authors visited St George’s University to participate in a research collaboration involving canine ehrlichiosis, which is a highly endemic canine tick borne disease on the island of Grenada. After reciting her medical history during a casual conversation, the woman elected to enter an ongoing study regarding Bartonella spp. infection in high risk patients, i.e. veterinary professionals (North Carolina State University Institutional Review Board approval IRB 1960–11). Written permission was given to also test for other vector borne organisms.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "Patient C was a 64-year-old female with cystitis and two samples were taken on the same day. Both isolates (HOS8 and HOS9) were ST144 and differed by five SNPs. While no SNPs occurred in VAGs (), two mutations with potential for functional change were identified in transposase TnpB (G11R) and environmental stress protein Ves (G7R). Conversely, in patient H, a 67-year-old male who presented with cystitis (HOS33; ST131 H30Rx) and then cystitis again a week later (HOS34; ST131 H30Rx), the two causative agents were indistinguishable.\nPatient F was a 72-year-old female with cystitis followed by urosepsis 181 days later (HOS26; ST131 H30R; 53 SNPs or 20 SNPs without recombination), followed by urosepsis 101 days later (HOS27; ST131 H30R; 61 or 27 SNPs) and then a subsequent sample was taken 3 days later (HOS28; ST131 H30R; 62 or 26 SNPs). The vast majority of SNPs were a result of recombination, which is 50–100 times more likely to occur than mutations [], and occurred in aerobactin biosynthesis protein iucC and iron transport system genes sitABC. However, three point mutations with potential change to function were identified in all urosepsis isolates: R18L in capsule protein KpsM, R268L in molybdoenzyme biosynthesis protein MoeA and M58R in molybdoenzyme chaperon protein YcdY. Intriguingly, HOS50 (also ST131 H30R), originating from a 50-year-old patient presenting with pyelonephritis 21 days prior to patient F’s initial presentation, also possessed these three precise amino acid substitutions produced by the same SNPs. These identical substitutions may be indicative of a shared source, particularly as both patients resided in the same postcode, or may be examples of pathoadaptive mutations that increase fitness in the upper urinary tract. However, no recombination events were detected in HOS50.\nLastly, patient K was a 2-year-old female who presented with urosepsis (HOS41; ST69) and subsequent urosepsis 100 days later (HOS42; ST69; 13 SNPs). Similar to isolates derived from patient B, most SNPs occurred within intergenic regions (); however, R133L in yersiniabactin protein ybtT and R337S in K+/H+ antiporter CvrA may have incurred functional changes. Future characterization of all these SNP-mediated mutations is required to ascertain any functional changes.",

Both isolates (HOS8 and HOS9) were ST144 and differed by five SNPs. While no SNPs occurred in VAGs (), two mutations with potential for functional change were identified in transposase TnpB (G11R) and environmental stress protein Ves (G7R). Conversely, in patient H, a 67-year-old male who presented with cystitis (HOS33; ST131 H30Rx) and then cystitis again a week later (HOS34; ST131 H30Rx), the two causative agents were indistinguishable.\nPatient F was a 72-year-old female with cystitis followed by urosepsis 181 days later (HOS26; ST131 H30R; 53 SNPs or 20 SNPs without recombination), followed by urosepsis 101 days later (HOS27; ST131 H30R; 61 or 27 SNPs) and then a subsequent sample was taken 3 days later (HOS28; ST131 H30R; 62 or 26 SNPs). The vast majority of SNPs were a result of recombination, which is 50–100 times more likely to occur than mutations [], and occurred in aerobactin biosynthesis protein iucC and iron transport system genes sitABC. However, three point mutations with potential change to function were identified in all urosepsis isolates: R18L in capsule protein KpsM, R268L in molybdoenzyme biosynthesis protein MoeA and M58R in molybdoenzyme chaperon protein YcdY. Intriguingly, HOS50 (also ST131 H30R), originating from a 50-year-old patient presenting with pyelonephritis 21 days prior to patient F’s initial presentation, also possessed these three precise amino acid substitutions produced by the same SNPs. These identical substitutions may be indicative of a shared source, particularly as both patients resided in the same postcode, or may be examples of pathoadaptive mutations that increase fitness in the upper urinary tract. However, no recombination events were detected in HOS50.\nLastly, patient K was a 2-year-old female who presented with urosepsis (HOS41; ST69) and subsequent urosepsis 100 days later (HOS42; ST69; 13 SNPs). Similar to isolates derived from patient B, most SNPs occurred within intergenic regions (); however, R133L in yersiniabactin protein ybtT and R337S in K+/H+ antiporter CvrA may have incurred functional changes. Future characterization of all these SNP-mediated mutations is required to ascertain any functional changes.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "We report on a 51-year-old woman who was treated for oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and HER2 positive breast cancer. She was diagnosed with supraclavicular lymph metastasis for which she initially received a combination of docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. After mastectomy, she continued with trastuzumab in combination with radiotherapy. Unfortunately, progression of disease with leptomeningeal metastasis was shown on MRI, and oral treatment with lapatinib and capecitabine was initiated. The patient discontinued oral treatment because of further progression and was switched to trastuzumab-emtansine infusions. Trastuzumab-emtansine was administered on day one of a 21-day cycle, as intravenous infusions via peripheral access. The weight-based dosage of 3.6 mg/kg was diluted with 250 mL of normal saline.\nAt the end of the infusion of the second cycle, extravasation of trastuzumab-emtansine was noticed by the oncology nurse while disconnecting the infusion line. As the infusion access was covered by the patient's clothes, the patient had not noticed the extravasation during infusion. At the time of discovery, the patient had a slightly erythematous, painless swelling. According to the size of the swelling, it was assumed that the total infusion volume had been administered subcutaneously. According to local protocol, the oncologist and hospital pharmacist were consulted to discuss whether supportive treatment was indicated.\nIt was decided to choose an observational approach, substantiated by statements in the product label about relatively mild reactions and a lack of (known) specific treatment strategies after trastuzumab-emtansine extravasations. However, one case of delayed epidermal necrosis after extravasation was reported, but no treatment strategies were provided. Therefore, the patient was instructed to elevate the affected arm in order to prevent further swelling, was informed about a possible delayed response and was instructed to contact her oncologist as soon as cutaneous symptoms (swelling, erythema and pain) worsened.\nThe next day, the patient experienced an increase in pain and erythema at the site of extravasation. There was no increase in swelling or skin temperature. Pain could be sufficiently managed with acetaminophen. We contacted the patient every other day to monitor the extravasation. After a week, the patient attended our oncology outpatient clinic. The erythema was expanded to a larger area. After consulting plastic surgery, watchful waiting was continued as the skin was intact and the extravasation was too long ago to consider other treatments (eg local hyaluronidase injection or liposuction). Four days later, the patient developed blisters and the skin turned somewhat darker. The blisters were removed, and the affected area was treated with silver sulphadiazine to prevent infection. The darker discoloration did not progress to full-thickness necrosis. Six weeks after the event, the lesion healed with residual hyperpigmentation of skin. The development of cutaneous symptoms over time is presented in Figure .",

The patient was referred to our department for further evaluation of the lesions. His medical history showed hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the family history was unremarkable. Physical examination and routine blood tests including inflammatory reaction were unremarkable. Urine examination showed large numbers of white blood cells in urine sediment, but midstream urine culture showed no growth of bacteria after antimicrobial therapy for 2 weeks at the local medical center. Urine cytology was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a cystic mass close to the urinary bladder with a partly irregular wall and a fistula to the urinary bladder (Fig. ). Cystoscopy demonstrated that the fistula was near the dome of the urinary bladder, which was surrounded by edematous mucosa. Histological findings of a transurethral biopsy of the fistula and edematous mucosa showed inflammatory change with glandular metaplasia and Brunn nests of the mucosa. The preoperative diagnosis was urachal tumor, and surgery for the tumor and fistula was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed a Meckel diverticulum (4.0 × 3.0 cm) at the oral side of the ileum 50 cm from the ileocecal junction, which was adherent to the dome of the urinary bladder. Meckel diverticulectomy and partial cystectomy were performed. Macroscopic findings of the specimen showed a tumor (2.2 cm) in the Meckel diverticulum with a fistula connected to the urinary bladder.

        "patient": "A 70-year-old Caucasian man with a previously diagnosed, IgG-kappa multiple myeloma presented with a 3-month history of worsening dyspnea, dysphagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was established one year prior to presentation with a serum kappa free light chain (K-FLC) level of 685 mg/dL and a lambda FLC level of 0.13 mg/dL (kappa/lambda (K/L) ratio of 5269). The patient had no lytic bone lesions or liver or heart involvement and had a normocellular bone marrow with 70% plasma cells. He was never noted to have macroglossia or albuminuria. His past medical history was otherwise notable for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease with Bence Jones proteinuria (K-FLC proteinuria of 691 mg/dL). Upon initial evaluation, the patient was hypoxic to 78% in room air. He appeared tachypneic, with an increased work of breathing and accessory muscle use. Auscultation revealed overall reduced breath sounds, bibasilar crackles, and an irregular cardiac rhythm with a holosystolic grade III/VI murmur loudest at the cardiac apex.\nThe patient's arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.31, a pCO2 of 60, and a pO2 of 60 mmHg. His labs otherwise revealed an bicarbonate of 33 mmol/L, a creatinine of 2.55 mg/dL (increased from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL), a hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 7.4 × 103 per μL. The patient also had a B-type natriuretic peptide level of 572 pg/mL and serial cardiac troponin I levels of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.21 ng/mL drawn 6 to 8 hours apart. His K-FLC level was 1379 mg/dL with L-FLC of 0.65 mg/dL (K/L-FLC ratio of 2121).\nA chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions. His echocardiogram was notable for elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 64 mmHg, biatrial dilatation with normal sized ventricles, and a preserved ejection fraction. A ventilation-perfusion scan was negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolus.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the cardiac stepdown unit for inotropic diuresis and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). After diuresis, a right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed PA pressure of 34/9/18 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean) and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg.\nDespite effective diuresis, the patient went into a worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure with almost continuous dependence on NIPPV. His pulmonary function tests revealed restrictive physiology with FEV1 of 61%, FVC of 58%, and FEV/FVC of 104%. A subsequent nerve conduction study was suggestive of bilateral phrenic axonal neuropathy.\nWith his worsening dysphagia and respiratory muscle weakness, the course was further complicated by aspiration pneumonitis. A barium swallow esophagram showed narrowing of the gastroesophageal junction and tertiary contractions in the esophagus. An upper endoscopy was unrevealing and biopsy samples were negative for amyloidosis, confirmed by lack of Congo red staining (not shown). A fat pad biopsy was also negative for amyloid.\nDue to deteriorating cardiopulmonary and renal status, the patient was transferred to our cardiac intensive care unit. A repeat RHC was performed and a right ventricular biopsy was diagnostic of cardiac amyloidosis. The patient subsequently received 3 doses of bortezomib and dexamethasone but passed away soon after from the multiorgan system failure, approximately 5 weeks after admission.\nAutopsy revealed IgG-kappa amyloid deposits in the left and right ventricles (), the diaphragm (), and the gastroesophageal junction (). There was no demyelination, amyloid deposition, or other abnormalities of the phrenic nerves (), nor was there amyloid infiltration of the lung parenchyma.",

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was established one year prior to presentation with a serum kappa free light chain (K-FLC) level of 685 mg/dL and a lambda FLC level of 0.13 mg/dL (kappa/lambda (K/L) ratio of 5269). The patient had no lytic bone lesions or liver or heart involvement and had a normocellular bone marrow with 70% plasma cells. He was never noted to have macroglossia or albuminuria. His past medical history was otherwise notable for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease with Bence Jones proteinuria (K-FLC proteinuria of 691 mg/dL). Upon initial evaluation, the patient was hypoxic to 78% in room air. He appeared tachypneic, with an increased work of breathing and accessory muscle use. Auscultation revealed overall reduced breath sounds, bibasilar crackles, and an irregular cardiac rhythm with a holosystolic grade III/VI murmur loudest at the cardiac apex.\nThe patient's arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.31, a pCO2 of 60, and a pO2 of 60 mmHg. His labs otherwise revealed an bicarbonate of 33 mmol/L, a creatinine of 2.55 mg/dL (increased from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL), a hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 7.4 × 103 per μL. The patient also had a B-type natriuretic peptide level of 572 pg/mL and serial cardiac troponin I levels of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.21 ng/mL drawn 6 to 8 hours apart. His K-FLC level was 1379 mg/dL with L-FLC of 0.65 mg/dL (K/L-FLC ratio of 2121).\nA chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions. His echocardiogram was notable for elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 64 mmHg, biatrial dilatation with normal sized ventricles, and a preserved ejection fraction. A ventilation-perfusion scan was negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolus.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the cardiac stepdown unit for inotropic diuresis and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). After diuresis, a right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed PA pressure of 34/9/18 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean) and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg.\nDespite effective diuresis, the patient went into a worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure with almost continuous dependence on NIPPV. His pulmonary function tests revealed restrictive physiology with FEV1 of 61%, FVC of 58%, and FEV/FVC of 104%. A subsequent nerve conduction study was suggestive of bilateral phrenic axonal neuropathy.\nWith his worsening dysphagia and respiratory muscle weakness, the course was further complicated by aspiration pneumonitis. A barium swallow esophagram showed narrowing of the gastroesophageal junction and tertiary contractions in the esophagus. An upper endoscopy was unrevealing and biopsy samples were negative for amyloidosis, confirmed by lack of Congo red staining (not shown). A fat pad biopsy was also negative for amyloid.\nDue to deteriorating cardiopulmonary and renal status, the patient was transferred to our cardiac intensive care unit. A repeat RHC was performed and a right ventricular biopsy was diagnostic of cardiac amyloidosis. The patient subsequently received 3 doses of bortezomib and dexamethasone but passed away soon after from the multiorgan system failure, approximately 5 weeks after admission.\nAutopsy revealed IgG-kappa amyloid deposits in the left and right ventricles (), the diaphragm (), and the gastroesophageal junction (). There was no demyelination, amyloid deposition, or other abnormalities of the phrenic nerves (), nor was there amyloid infiltration of the lung parenchyma.''' \n\n output:"

Due to decreased vision of the left eye, which had occurred seven years ago, and decreased vision of the right eye occurring 2 months before visiting the hospital, he was diagnosed as optic neuritis and received a steroid treatment from other hospital. He had discontinued the medication and was under prognostic observation. The vision in both of his eyes at the time of visiting the hospital were decreased but still he was able to distinguish shapes or colors of all objects.\nHis consciousness was clear, and eye movements, facial symmetry and sensory functions were normal other than the existing sight disorder. The muscular strength of extremities showed MRC grade III in the right upper limb, grade IV in the left upper limb, and grade IV in both lower limbs. When conducting the sensory test, there were slightly degraded pain senses, vibration senses, tactile senses and location senses below T4 skin fragments. He showed a positive response to Lhermitte's sign where the patient has sensations of electrical current flowing through his bilateral arms when suddenly flexing his head forward. The deep tendon reflexes of extremities were all normal, and both sides showed negative responses to the Babinski reflex. As abdominal distention was observed, 1000 cc of urine was drained after insertion of a urinary catheter.\nDuring the spinal magnetic resonance imaging (spine MRI), a high intensity signal of T2 was shown from C1-T8 spine () and the findings from the brain MRI were normal. The number of cells, the chemical values and IgG index were normal in the cerebrospinal fluid tests, whereas the oligoclonal band was negative also.\nThe visual evoked potential test showed poor waveforms from both sides, whereas the left posterior tibial nerve sensory evoked a potential test among the somatosensory evoked potential test showing an abnormality reasonable for central nerve conduction disorder, and the auditory evoked potential test results were normal. Basic blood tests, urinalysis, vasculitis test and thyroid function tests were all normal and from the autoimmune antibody test, it showed positive response to the AQP4 antibody.\nAs the guardian commented that the patient is gradually speaking less, has a reduction of interest in hobby activities, and has character and behavioral changes such as being unable to control his appetite and becoming furious to insignificant matter, we conducted the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery for additional evaluation. The patient's education level was graduation from high school; his score on the Korean Version of the Mini-Mental State Examination was 22 points whereas the clinical dementia rating was 1 point (). In the case of this patient, the profile of frontal lobe dysfunctions was prominent compared to other cognitive domains.\nThe patient was diagnosed as NMO and treated with methylprednisolone 1g via IV administration once daily for 5 days. After the treatment, the muscle power of the bilateral upper limbs was observed as MRC grade IV, and the muscle power of his lower limbs was the same as measured at the time of admission. Since the patient had no large scale change in the conditions, he is under prognostic observation as being treated with prednisolone and azathioprine from the out-patient department currently without recurrence for about 1 year. After 1 year of time lapse, we conducted the Neuropsychological Screening Battery (NSB) again for cognitive function evaluation, and frontal lobe functions showing an improving trend but there were no large changes in other domains compared to the conditions before NSB ().",

A 56-year-old female with underlying bronchial asthma presented with cough, sputum, and fever for 10 days. Chest x-ray and CT taken in an outside clinic were told to be normal. She received symptomatic treatment. However, her symptoms did not improve. On admission, peripheral blood examination revealed leukocytosis (12,230/mm3) and increased C-reactive protein level (41.9 mg/L). Review of chest CT transferred from outside hospital revealed a small paratracheal cystic lesion with air-fluid level and rim enhancement in the thoracic inlet (Fig. A and B). A small lymph node was seen in the adjacent area (not shown here). Zenker's diverticulum or infected paratracheal air cyst was suspected. Esophagography showed no evidence of diverticulum. Endobronchial ultrasound revealed about 15 mm sized right paratracheal hypoechoic mass corresponding to the lesion on CT scan (Fig. C).

        "patient": "A 37-year-old male patient with incisal edge fractures of maxillary central incisors, and therefore with esthetic complaints, referred to the faculty clinics. Old composite restorations, surrounded with secondary caries, were detected at the mesial edges of maxillary central incisors of the patient after clinical and radiographic examinations. Moreover, attritions involving enamel and also dentin tissues at the incisal edges of maxillary and mandibular central incisors, due to a possible bruxism problem, were noted ().\nAccording to the patient’s history, the composite restorations were about five years old and the patient’s chief complaint was the unesthetic appearance of the restorations. He rejected ceramic laminate veneers or ceramic crowns as treatment options. The remaining tooth structures were adequate for both teeth for composite laminate veneer restorations. In spite of bruxism, direct composite laminate veneer restorations for both maxillary central incisors were considered, especially due to the need for the high compressive strength in this case.\nFollowing local anesthetics for maxillary centrals, old restorations were removed with a high-speed handpiece (NSK Pana Air, Japan) and a round diamond bur (Acurata, Germany) under water cooling; 0.8-mm-deep walls were prepared on the labial surfaces of the teeth. Cervical borders of the preparations were arranged just at the same line of the gingiva by setting a cervical step without impinging on the natural gingival contour ().\nAs the cavity preparations were completed, shade was selected as A2 on the Vita scale.\nFor mesial and distal margins of the teeth, transparent matrix bands were cut, applied and fixed with appropriate wedges (). Then, 37% phosphoric acid (Etching Gel, Kerr, USA) was applied on the enamel surfaces for 15 seconds, rinsed with water spray for 20 seconds and dried slightly. One-bottle bonding agent (Adper Single Bond, 3M ESPE, USA) was applied in two layers on the prepared tooth surfaces by using a bonding brush and polymerized with a light-curing unit (Demi LED Light Curing System, 450 nm, Kerr, USA) for 20 seconds. In order to prevent any dark color reflection on the prepared surfaces, opaque A2 shade composite resin (Herculite XRV Ultra, Kerr, USA) was applied to the palatal sides and polymerized with a light-curing unit. Later, the cavities were filled with A2 shade of composite resin (Herculite XRV Ultra, Kerr, USA) incrementally and polymerized each time for 40 seconds.\nFor finishing and polishing procedures, first a yellow-banded knife-edge bur (Acurata, Germany) was used in a high-speed handpiece (NSK Pana Air, Japan). For advanced polishing, discs (Ultra Gloss Composite Polishing System, Axis, USA) in different dimensions were used from coarse to fine grits ().\nThe patient was instructed in the oral hygiene and called at 6 months.

        "title": "A Sri Lankan girl with a new genetic variant in the PKLR gene causing pyruvate kinase deficiency: a case report",
        "patient": "An 8-year-old Sri Lankan, Sinhalese girl, the third child of nonconsanguineous parents, was delivered by elective cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation with the Apgar 18, 59, and 109. Her prenatal history was uneventful with a birth weight of 2.13 kg and head circumference of 35 cm. There was no family history of anemia or other hematological disorders. She was found to be pale and have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera 2 hours after birth (T = 0), which was highly suggestive of hemolysis. Her blood pressure was 80/55 mmHg, pulse rate was > 100 beats per minute, and she was well hydrated. She had no fever or hypothermia. She did not have any dysmorphism, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly. A nontender hepatomegaly was just palpable. Examination of systems was normal including the absence of focal neurological manifestations and limb weakness. At the initial presentation, her hemoglobin (Hb) was 55 g/L with normal white cells (total white cell count 8.8 × 109/L, neutrophils 60%, nucleated red cells, and lymphocytes 35%) and platelets (430 × 109/L). Blood film showed anisopoikilocytosis with marked polychromasia. Reticulocyte count was 9.6%. Total bilirubin was 15.6 mg/dL with an indirect fraction of 13 mg/dL. Rest of her liver function and renal function tests were within normal limits. There was no laboratory evidence of intravascular hemolysis. Urinalysis showed increased urobilinogen. Screen for bacterial and viral infections was negative. Both the mother and child were A Rh positive, and direct Coombs test in both was negative. In addition, the mother was negative for antibody screening. The baby was given double volume exchange transfusion and phototherapy on suspicion of a possible rare blood group incompatibility, although direct Coombs was negative.\nA month later (T = 1), she presented with symptoms of anemia, and her Hb had fallen to 45 g/L. She was screened for G6PD deficiency and was found to have a normal G6PD enzyme level, 6.60 µg/dL (normal range 4.60–13.5 µg/dL) with a normal Brewer test. The osmotic fragility test was also negative. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of hemoglobin revealed no evidence of β-thalassemia or an Hb variant at 4 months of age. This was consistent with genetic analysis examining the five common β-globin gene mutations in Sri Lanka causing β-thalassemia (IVSI-1G>A, IVSI-5G>C, Cd8/9, Cd41/42) and HbE (HBB:c.79G>A, p.Glu27Lys), none of which was detected in her DNA sample. Bone marrow biopsy was compatible with hemolytic anemia with increased iron stores. Pyruvate kinase enzyme activity and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate level were not assessed as these investigations are not performed in Sri Lanka. She had repeated admissions due to similar clinical features. At the age of 8 years, Sanger sequencing of the PKLR gene was performed on a blood sample provided to collaborators at King’s College Hospital, London, who had established a diagnostic gene sequencing assay of the pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR). The child’s genetic test was performed without any incurrence of costs to the patient as Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country and the test was not available in Sri Lanka. The gene sequencing identified her to be homozygous for the c.507+1delG pathogenic variant, which deletes the first base of the intron after exon 4. The last codon of exon 4 is GGG (glycine) and is followed by GT in the intron, and it is the G base in the intron that is deleted. This variant therefore affects the canonical 5ʹ donor splice site. As the proceeding exon bases are also GGG, the donor splice site is predicted to be one base into the exon, and the transcript will remove the last G base, causing a frameshift in the protein sequence, predicted to be p.(Gly170Valfs*9). These abnormal transcripts are usually removed by nonsense-mediated decay. As this individual is homozygous, she does not produce any pyruvate kinase enzyme, which is consistent with the diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency.\nShe did not receive any specific interventions for her hemolysis. She continues to have low-grade hemolysis for which she is on regular blood transfusions at 1–2-monthly intervals since the diagnosis was made at the age of 8 years. This has resulted in iron overload for which she is on deferasirox. She has been followed up monthly at the hematology clinic. Her weight and height were within the reference range [median + 1 standard deviation (SD) in weight and height growth curves] for her age, with no organomegaly. Since she was on regular blood transfusions, her cognitive, motor, social–emotional, and neurophysiologic development was age appropriate. Her bone age was not assessed. Her quality of life was reasonably good. Her activities of daily living was not affected by the disease. Her parents are also coping with her condition pragmatically.",

The osmotic fragility test was also negative. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of hemoglobin revealed no evidence of β-thalassemia or an Hb variant at 4 months of age. This was consistent with genetic analysis examining the five common β-globin gene mutations in Sri Lanka causing β-thalassemia (IVSI-1G>A, IVSI-5G>C, Cd8/9, Cd41/42) and HbE (HBB:c.79G>A, p.Glu27Lys), none of which was detected in her DNA sample. Bone marrow biopsy was compatible with hemolytic anemia with increased iron stores. Pyruvate kinase enzyme activity and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate level were not assessed as these investigations are not performed in Sri Lanka. She had repeated admissions due to similar clinical features. At the age of 8 years, Sanger sequencing of the PKLR gene was performed on a blood sample provided to collaborators at King’s College Hospital, London, who had established a diagnostic gene sequencing assay of the pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR). The child’s genetic test was performed without any incurrence of costs to the patient as Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country and the test was not available in Sri Lanka. The gene sequencing identified her to be homozygous for the c.507+1delG pathogenic variant, which deletes the first base of the intron after exon 4. The last codon of exon 4 is GGG (glycine) and is followed by GT in the intron, and it is the G base in the intron that is deleted. This variant therefore affects the canonical 5ʹ donor splice site. As the proceeding exon bases are also GGG, the donor splice site is predicted to be one base into the exon, and the transcript will remove the last G base, causing a frameshift in the protein sequence, predicted to be p.(Gly170Valfs*9). These abnormal transcripts are usually removed by nonsense-mediated decay. As this individual is homozygous, she does not produce any pyruvate kinase enzyme, which is consistent with the diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency.\nShe did not receive any specific interventions for her hemolysis. She continues to have low-grade hemolysis for which she is on regular blood transfusions at 1–2-monthly intervals since the diagnosis was made at the age of 8 years. This has resulted in iron overload for which she is on deferasirox. She has been followed up monthly at the hematology clinic. Her weight and height were within the reference range [median + 1 standard deviation (SD) in weight and height growth curves] for her age, with no organomegaly. Since she was on regular blood transfusions, her cognitive, motor, social–emotional, and neurophysiologic development was age appropriate. Her bone age was not assessed. Her quality of life was reasonably good. Her activities of daily living was not affected by the disease. Her parents are also coping with her condition pragmatically.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A simple hepatic cyst was detected in the left lobe of the liver of a 25-year-old man in 1993 (Sadly, there was no imaging.). The patient was followed in our hospital, and no surgical treatment was performed although the cyst showed gradual enlargement. The patient was admitted to our hospital due to epigastralgia and for re-examination of simple hepatic cyst in 2004. In 1996 the cyst was unilocular, 6 cm in diameter without calcification, septa or papillary projections as observed by CT (Fig. ). In 2001 the cyst remained the same diameter but exhibited calcification and septa (Fig. ). An abdominal CT performed on admission in 2004 showed that the unilocular cyst had grown to over 10 cm in diameter with increasing mounting calcification, septa and thickening of the wall within the cyst (Fig. ). MRI revealed a partly low intensity, partly high intensity T1-weighted image, and high intensity T2-weighted image (Fig. ). US revealed a unilocular cyst over 10 cm in diameter and partial septa within the cyst (Fig. ). Abdominal angiography showed the tumor to be hypovascular and stretching of left hepatic artery. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed compression of the bile duct and no communication between the cyst and the bile duct was shown. The serum level of aspartame aminotransferase (AST) and almandine aminotransferase (ALT) were slightly elevated but tumor markers such as CEA and CA 19-9 were within the normal range. The cystic lesion was suspected of being a mucin-producing liver tumor, such as hepatobiliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Despite of these findings, we could not rule out the malignancy clearly. Therefore, in November 2004, left lobectomy of the liver with cholecystectomy was performed. Macroscopically, a resected specimen was a unilocular tumor filled with mucus. The cut surface of the tumor exhibited an elastic white-colored scar and yellowish papillary nodule (Fig. ). The unilocular cyst had a solid component with papillary projections, septa and calcification and was filled with liquid-like muddy bile. Histopathological examination revealed that the inner layer of the cyst was lined columnar epithelium exhibiting mild grade dysplasia and partially lined with papillary epithelium (Fig. ). Dense mesenchymal stroma was not detected. On the basis of these findings, hepatobiliary cystadenoma was diagnosed. The postoperative course was uneventful and recurrence of the lesion has not been observed.

On spirometry, forced vital capacity (FVC) was 3.84 L (90.4% predicted), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 2.76 L (71.9% predicted), and the FEV1/FVC ratio was 71.9. A methacholine challenge test revealed mild bronchial hyperreactivity (provocative concentration producing a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) to 8.0 mg/mL). Asthma was diagnosed on the basis of the asthma symptoms and nonspecific bronchial hyper reactivity of the patient.\nDespite the diagnosis of asthma, he had been living without any symptoms, had not been receiving treatments, and he gained employment at an automotive bumper and vehicle control display mold manufacturer in March 2004 and worked on grinding. He started working on a plastic injection process simulation in May 2006. His cough and breathing difficulties became aggravated starting in 2010, approximately 4 years after starting work in injection molding. In December 2011, he presented to the emergency department of a local hospital at around 23:00 hours, prompted by breathing difficulties while resting after work. An arterial blood gas analysis on admission revealed hypoxia with an arterial oxygen partial pressure of 50.2 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 86%. Chest radiographs did not indicate abnormalities. The peripheral blood examination manifested normal leukocyte counts (10,000/μL), whereas the eosinophil percentage was elevated (7.5%; reference range, 0–7%). Therefore, he was considered to have had an asthma attack and was subsequently hospitalized, where he received oxygen and bronchodilator treatments. Spirometry conducted during hospitalization revealed respiratory obstruction with a FVC of 1.87 L (57% of predicted), FEV1 of 1.23 L (46% of predicted), and a FEV1/FVC ratio of 65.8. The patient presented to the emergency department again because of an asthma attack in March 2012.\nIn June 2012, the patient finished overtime work at 21:10 hours and visited a massage parlor 5 minutes driving distance from the company at around 22:30 hours. After being seated and waiting 20 minutes for his appointment, he suddenly had breathing difficulties. He was evacuated to the local hospital but ultimately died. At the hospital he was transferred to, he exhibited resistance during ambu bagging. In addition, expiratory wheezing was heard from both lungs during physical examination, which led to the diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation. In accordance with the request of the bereaved, the National Forensic Service conducted an autopsy and concluded the death was caused by an acute asthma attack.\nThe health insurance reimbursement history from 2002 confirmed that the patient received 2 or 3 treatments per year at the clinic that prescribed his inhaler. He underwent 11 treatments in 2010, which was 4 years after starting work with the injection process; the number notably increased to 29 times in 2011.\nHis colleagues knew he had asthma but did not notice any abnormalities during regular working hours. They mentioned that he coughed frequently and felt out of breath after dinner on the day of his death because of the amount of work he had performed.\nNothing specific was found in his medical history except for the aforementioned bronchial asthma. Furthermore, he smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 24 years. A health check-up performed in 2011 did not reveal any abnormal findings except for obesity.\nThe patient started working in an automotive bumper and vehicle control display mold manufacturer in March 2004 at the age of 39 years and died due to the asthma in June 2012 at 47 years of age. His working procedure was as follows: die design→machining→grinding→injection process simulation and inspection. The patient ground the processed mold at the time of admission and was working on product injection process simulation and inspection of the finished mold from May 2006.\nInjection process simulation is a working process in which injection is performed to test the correct functioning of a new mold. In the injection process simulation, mold-releasing agents are sprayed onto the prepared mold. When the injection molding machine is closed, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), nylon, acetal, and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) resins in pellet form are automatically injected to the die and heated. After around 2–3 minutes, the products are pulled out from the injection molding machine and inspected (Figure ). The average daily workload of this work process involves injection process simulations of 3–7 dyes; the types of resin and duration of handling widely vary depending on working circumstances. During the process of opening the injection molding machine and removing the products, workers can be exposed to fumes released from the melted resins. The risk of exposure to a large amount of fumes is especially high while the residual resin left in the injector is removed to change the dye (Figure ).\nThe injection temperature differs with respect to the resin used as follows: 240–260°C, 230–250°C, 280°C, 220°C, and 250–300°C for ABS, polyethylene and polypropylene, nylon, acetal, and PBT resins, respectively.\nLubricating rust inhibitors (i.e., WD-40), mold-releasing agents (i.e., KF96 spray), slideway oil (i.e., Mobil Vactra Oil No.4), and hydraulic oil (i.e., Mobil DTE24) are utilized in the injection process simulation. Slideway and hydraulic oil are intermittently added to the machine, and lubricating rust inhibitors and mold-releasing agents are mainly handled by the workers. The major components of the 2 products from material safety data sheet (MSDS) are WD-40 comprises hydrotreated light distillate (concentration: 30–40%), solvent-dewaxed heavy paraffinic distillate (concentration: 6–12%), isobutane (concentration: 8–12%), n-butane, (28~32%), and trade-secret material (concentration <12%). The KF96 spray comprises dimethylpolysiloxane (concentration: 5%) and liquefied petroleum gas, (concentration: 95%). None of these components are asthma triggers.\nThere was no local ventilation system in the vicinity of the injection molding machine, and the molds were produced in a separate factory building not adjacent to the workplace of the deceased the patient. In the workplace where he used to work with injection molding processes, only noise in the working environment had been assessed at that time.\nBecause different resins are used for different durations depending on the work situation, it was inappropriate to assess all resins used by the deceased the patient through working environment measurements. Therefore, the resins utilized in the workplace were collected, and the injection process was reproduced by heating the resins at the actual injection temperature to assess the resultant substances. With exception of PBT resins, which we were unable to obtain from the site, 5 resins in pellet form utilized in the injection process, namely ABS, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, and acetal resins, were heated at their actual injection temperatures by a pyrolyzer (Model EGA/PY-3030D, Frontier Lab Ltd.). The products were qualitatively analyzed by a gas chromatography mass analyzer (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC, 5975C MSD; Table ). Styrene, which is a known asthma-inducing substance, benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, and octadecyl ester were detected from the ABS resin.",

        "patient": "An 82-year-old man presented to us for right ear pain and itch for about one week. He had a history of hearing loss for many years with periodic right otorrhea. He had no headaches, and his nose was asymptomatic. He was on oral medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia. He had cardiac bypass for ischaemic heart disease 6 months before.\nExamination of the left ear showed a healed eardrum perforation. The right ear showed a large retained cotton swab in the medial end of the external ear canal. The external ear canal skin including the bony-cartilaginous junction was not inflamed. On removing the cotton foreign body from the right ear with a pair of microforceps under microscopy, a rapid gush of copious pus was observed emanating from the middle ear through a perforation of the underlying eardrum. The eardrum perforation was large, central in position, and appeared chronic with edges that were scarred (). Aural toilet with vacuum suction was performed, and topical ciprofloxacin eardrops were prescribed. The patient was given a 1-week follow-up review appointment which he defaulted.\nThe patient returned 1 month later with a new symptom of coughing while eating for 2 weeks associated with right ear pain.

Physical examination on admission was significant for tachypnea (respiratory rate was 36 per minute), hypotension (blood pressure was 88/56 mmHg), and confusion. The patient was admitted initially for acute exacerbation of COPD and was started on oxygen through nasal cannula, IV fluids, and IV azithromycin and ceftriaxone which were given after obtaining the cultures. Chest x-ray (CXR) showed no consolidations or infiltrates. Twelve hours after admission, the patient became more hypotensive (78/49 mmHg) and was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit. Her antibiotics regimen was switched to IV piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and she was started on vasopressors and hydrocortisone. Three days after admission, despite being on high requirements of vasopressors, broad spectrum antibiotics, and hydrocortisone, the patient showed no improvement and was still febrile (38.9°C). Her cultures (urine, blood, and sputum) from admission showed no growth. Further investigations revealed hypertriglyceridemia (312 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (30 K/uL), leukopenia (2.6 K/uL), hyperferritinemia (6872 ng/dL), hypofibrinogenemia (69 mg/dL), normal coagulation profile, normal procalcitonin, and negative work-up for connective tissue diseases (including anti-nuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor) and viral infections (including hepatitis A/B/C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus 19, and Epstein–Barr virus). Peripheral blood smear was unremarkable as well.\nFamily history was significant for malignancies in her first-degree relatives (lung and brain malignancies). Thus, a computerized tomography scan without contrast (due to renal failure) was performed for chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which revealed moderate splenomegaly. HLH was highly suspected, and therefore, soluble cluster differentiation 25 (CD-25) sent which was elevated (1521 U/mL). A bone marrow aspirate was also performed and showed hemophagocytosis ( and ). It was decided to start the patient on IV methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) while waiting for flow cytometry testing and cytogenetics results. Three days after the methylprednisolone was started, the patient improved markedly and was no longer in septic shock. One week later, the results of flow cytometry and cytogenetics were negative for any lymphomas or leukemias; thus, the patient was switched to HLH-94 protocol (high dose of dexamethasone and etoposide). One week after initiation of the protocol, her mean arterial pressure was maintained above 65 mmHg and had not developed any episodes of fever ( summarizes the trend of the important laboratory values and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score).

He reported that the neck pain was progressive, localized, non-radiating, aggravated by movement, and upon standing from a seated position, along with intermittent vision changes over the past few months. The patient denied fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, dizziness and his Zubrod performance status was zero.\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was vitally stable. The complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable, chest x-ray, urine analysis and blood cultures did not show infection. A neurological exam was significant for decreased active range of motion of the cervical spine with pain on palpation of the right trapezius but no appreciable erythema or mass. The exam was negative for focal weakness or paresthesia, and deep tendon reflexes were 2+. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without IV contrast showed multiple heterogeneous intracranial masses with resultant mass effect compressing the cerebral aqueduct with dilation of the 3rd and 4th ventricles hydrocephalus and tonsillar herniation ().\nNeurosurgery performed a suboccipital craniotomy, partially resected the cerebellar mass, and placed a parietal to frontal shunt catheter, which significantly reduced the size of the ventricles. Biopsy results from the cerebellar mass demonstrated cerebellar tissue involved by a diffuse proliferation of foamy histiocytes and spindle cells admixed with prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (). Immunohistochemistry showed that the histiocytes were positive for CD68, CD163, Factor XIIIa, and Fascin. They are negative for S100, CD1a and SALL4. Further testing revealed the specimen was positive for BRAF V600E/D mutation, but the assay cannot differentiate between Langerhans and non-Langerhans histiocytosis.\nAn evaluation for extracranial involvement was ordered and included a bone scan, PET scan, and cardiac MRI. Bone scan showed high-intensity trace uptake in the skull, mandible, predominantly distal long bones of the upper and lower extremities is consistent with widespread histiocytosis ().\nPET scan showed hypermetabolic uptake within the medullary portions of the diffuse abnormal lesions of the distal femurs, tibias, and fibulas, and cardiac MRI was unremarkable. The patient was started on vemurafenib and continued to show improvement in a 3-month outpatient follow-up.",

He reported that the neck pain was progressive, localized, non-radiating, aggravated by movement, and upon standing from a seated position, along with intermittent vision changes over the past few months. The patient denied fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, dizziness and his Zubrod performance status was zero.\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was vitally stable. The complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable, chest x-ray, urine analysis and blood cultures did not show infection. A neurological exam was significant for decreased active range of motion of the cervical spine with pain on palpation of the right trapezius but no appreciable erythema or mass. The exam was negative for focal weakness or paresthesia, and deep tendon reflexes were 2+. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without IV contrast showed multiple heterogeneous intracranial masses with resultant mass effect compressing the cerebral aqueduct with dilation of the 3rd and 4th ventricles hydrocephalus and tonsillar herniation ().\nNeurosurgery performed a suboccipital craniotomy, partially resected the cerebellar mass, and placed a parietal to frontal shunt catheter, which significantly reduced the size of the ventricles. Biopsy results from the cerebellar mass demonstrated cerebellar tissue involved by a diffuse proliferation of foamy histiocytes and spindle cells admixed with prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (). Immunohistochemistry showed that the histiocytes were positive for CD68, CD163, Factor XIIIa, and Fascin. They are negative for S100, CD1a and SALL4. Further testing revealed the specimen was positive for BRAF V600E/D mutation, but the assay cannot differentiate between Langerhans and non-Langerhans histiocytosis.\nAn evaluation for extracranial involvement was ordered and included a bone scan, PET scan, and cardiac MRI. Bone scan showed high-intensity trace uptake in the skull, mandible, predominantly distal long bones of the upper and lower extremities is consistent with widespread histiocytosis ().\nPET scan showed hypermetabolic uptake within the medullary portions of the diffuse abnormal lesions of the distal femurs, tibias, and fibulas, and cardiac MRI was unremarkable. The patient was started on vemurafenib and continued to show improvement in a 3-month outpatient follow-up.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 21 year old presented in July 2004 complaining of a large painless lump in the left arm pit which he reported as a problem of six months duration. He was a manual laborer working from Tamil Nadu, India. He had no history of episodic fever, cough, weight loss, swelling of the left upper extremity or any lumps elsewhere in the body. Clinical examination revealed a mobile and non-tender mass of matted lymph nodes measuring 5 cm × 5 cm with heterogeneous (soft to firm) consistency with some cystic areas, in the central part of the left axilla (Figure ). No other lymph node groups were significantly enlarged. External genitalia were normal. General examination revealed no other abnormalities. A clinical diagnosis of tubercular axillary lymphadenitis was entertained.\nA chest x-ray was unremarkable. There was no evidence of leucocytosis, eosinophilia or parasites in his venous blood, sampled during the day. Routine and microscopic examination of the urine was within normal limits. Fine needle (21 G) aspiration cytology from the axillary mass revealed a scanty aspirate, smears from which showed features suggestive of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.\nAn ultrasound scan of the left axilla in real-time B-mode and M-mode was carried out by an experienced sonologist in the presence of one of the authors (AB) with a Toshiba (Justvision 400) ultrasound machine (Toshiba Medical System Corporation, Togichi, Japan) and a 7.5 MHz linear phased array transducer. The scan revealed a lobulated heterogeneous soft tissue mass of size 5.5 cm × 4.5 cm × 5.0 cm. The mass consisted of solid hypoechoic areas (each 2 cm × 1 cm) with multiple dilated tortuous anechoic channels (suggestive of grossly dilated lymphatics) of varying diameter (7 mm to 10 mm). There was no evidence of calcification or the typical filarial dance sign of Wuchereria bancrofti inside the dilated channels (Figure ). A sonographic diagnosis of the left axillary lymphadenopathy with lymphangiectasia was made. Fine needle aspiration cytology from the dilated lymphatics and the solid areas was then performed and microscopic examination of which revealed multiple microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti in a background of reactive lymphoid cells (Figure ). A scrotal ultrasound scan was not done as the external genitalia were normal.\nA nocturnal venous blood smear examination (three weeks after presentation) showed eosinophilia but failed to show any microfilaria. The absolute eosinophil count was 2520/mm3. A thick venous blood smear examination taken one hour after the administration of 100 mg oral diethylcarbamazine (in the daytime) (DEC provocation test) revealed numerous typical microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti (Figure ). The microfilarial density however, was not determined.\nThe patient then received oral diethylcarbamazine (100 mg q8 h) for 3 weeks. In October 2004 the size of the axillary mass and diameter of the lymphatic vessels had reduced in size considerably. This was confirmed by a repeat ultrasound examination of the left axilla (performed by the same sonologist using the same ultrasound machine), which revealed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass of 3.0 cm × 3.0 cm × 4.5 cm with dilated tortuous lymphatic channels, diameter less than 5 mm (Figure ). The patient had no other symptoms or signs attributable to filariasis. No scrotal nodules developed during the period of treatment. Repeated microscopic examinations of thick smears of the patient's venous blood taken at night yielded no microfilaria.

        "patient": "A 36-year-old female with a past medical history of severe CD and multiple sclerosis presented to the emergency department after 1 week of left lower abdominal pain. The patient had initially been diagnosed with severe CD 5 years prior to current presentation. The initial therapy had included sulfasalazine and azathioprine, with mild improvement in symptoms. Azathioprine was stopped due to development of painful blisters. She was also treated with 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, and adalimumab, which were stopped due to side effects. 6-Mercaptopurine caused loss of appetite, infliximab caused infusion reactions, and adalimumab caused severe migraines. After starting certolizumab, her symptoms were controlled, but it subsequently unmasked and exacerbated the underlying multiple sclerosis. Further evaluation revealed that she was also positive for the JC (John Cunningham) virus. Thus, certolizumab was stopped as well.\nAbout 18 months prior to current presentation, she was admitted for cramping right lower quadrant abdominal pain that worsened after eating. It was associated with occasional nausea but no vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis at that time showed wall thickening of the distal ileum, terminal ileum, and segments of the small intestine, as well as intermittent inflammatory worsening of the ileocecal valve, suspicious of the enteroenteric and enterovesical fistulous tract. Colorectal surgery was advised and an exploratory laparotomy performed with lysis of adhesions, resulting in an ileocecectomy. After this event, she remained without any therapy for her CD until starting vedolizumab 2 months prior to current presentation due to intolerance to immunomodulators, and inability to receive anti-TNF therapy due to multiple sclerosis and JC virus positivity. She received 3 doses of vedolizumab, causing significant improvement in symptoms.\nThe patient had started experiencing new-onset abdominal discomfort 1 week prior to the current admission. The pain was pressure-like and squeezing, wrapping around her abdomen in a belt-like fashion. It was worse on her left flank and radiated to her left leg. She had associated nausea and over 10 episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. The physical examination was remarkable for left lower abdominal tenderness without guarding or rigidity. The laboratory data revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 15.73 × 103/μL. Serum C-reactive protein was 0.7 mg/dL and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 23 mm/h, which was lower than during her previous episodes of CD flare-ups, with C-reactive protein up to 2.2 mg/dL and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate up to 31 mm/h in the past. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an approximately 10-cm left ovarian mass that was cystic in nature with soft tissue and a bony component, suggestive of a dermoid cyst (Fig. ). A previous CT scan 18 months prior to current presentation had not revealed any findings regarding any ovarian lesions (Fig. ). Obstetric-gynecological care and colorectal surgery were consulted, and the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy and lysis of adhesions. Surgical pathology confirmed the mass to be a mature cystic teratoma, measuring 12.6 × 7.8 × 7.5 cm with extensive hemorrhagic necrosis consistent with ovarian torsion. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged with outpatient follow-up.",

The pain was continuous, started suddenly with severity of 10/10 according to the patient with no diurnal variation or radiation. Moreover, it was sharp in nature, aggravated by movement and relieved by rest. The pain was associated with nausea and vomiting (gastric content). There was no history of change in bowel habits, urine, nor cardiopulmonary symptoms. The patient consumes alcohol on rare occasions, approximately one to two cups per month, and is known to be a smoker. The patient denied any history of abdominal trauma, scorpion bites, current medication use, or previous similar complaint. Family history was insignificant of autoimmune disease, inherited diseases, or similar complaints. The patient's surgical history was unremarkable. The patient was known to have morbid obesity, for which he underwent a minimally invasive procedure; an IGB was inserted seven months ago. As a result, he lost 17 kg, from 98 kg to 81 kg.\nOn examination, the patient was hemodynamically and vitally stable.

The pain started about 6 hours previously and was worsening progressively. A few hours before he visited the hospital he complained of proctalgia and rectal bleeding, and an abdominal discomfort of mild pain, which had started 2 to 4 hours ago; he had been examined by the on-duty physicians who failed to establish an accurate diagnosis. In the physical examination, he seemed to be severely ill and was presenting bradycardia (47 beats per minute) and mild tachypnea, while his body temperature and blood pressure were within the normal values. His abdomen was moderately distended and he presented tenderness with rebound during palpation and rigidity of his abdominal wall. Bowel sounds were absent. In a digital examination, although his rectum was found free of content the pouch of Douglas was very painful. Blood analysis revealed only a mild leucocytosis with neutrophil predominance. His arterial blood gas values were within the normal range. An abdominal radiography showed some rare small air-fluid levels of his small bowel and a large air-fluid level of his sigmoid colon as seen in Figures and . An abdominal ultrasound revealed the existence of free fluid around his liver, spleen and Douglas’s pouch. The initial preoperative diagnosis according to existing diagnostic and clinical findings was acute abdomen possibly due to sigmoid volvulus. An urgent diagnostic laparotomy was carried out through a midline incision. The findings were a large amount of bloody fluid and necrosis of an extended area of his small bowel and sigmoid colon. His gangrenous sigmoid colon was distended in torsion surrounded by a loop of ileum strangulating it, forming a tangle of knotting. Furthermore, some gangrenous loops of the ileum were encircled by the same ileal loop, which was wrapped at the basis of the sigmoid volvulus, forming a second tangle of tying. Unraveling these complex intestinal knots was difficult to perform and it was accomplished by using a suction needle to deflate the distended sigmoid colon. The spontaneous untying of the compound intestinal knotting that followed was impressive. Afterwards, the necrotized loops of his ileum (about 150cm) and sigmoid colon were resected. Both small and large intestine continuity were restored by primary end-to-end anastomosis. His postoperative course was uncomplicated and he was discharged on the 15th postoperative day. Since then he remains free of symptoms.",

        "title": "Tattoo-Associated Sarcoidosis With Severe Uveitis Successfully Treated With Mycophenolate Mofetil: A Report of Two Cases",
        "patient": "A 26-year-old Guyanese male who worked at a warehouse presented with worsening left red-eye and blurry vision for two weeks. The ophthalmologist started on prednisolone eye drop, which initially controlled his eye symptoms. However, he noticed new, small skin papules on the left forearm of the tattoo that he had received five years ago. He had no significant medical history or family history of sarcoidosis. On physical examination, he was found to have a bilateral conjunctival injection, a tattoo with small bumps on the left forearm and upper arm, and no erythema or discharge was noted around the tattoo.\nResults of laboratory studies, including serum calcium, were normal; additionally, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 6 mm/h, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 55 U/L (ref 14-82 U/L), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2 mg/L (normal: less than 10 mg/L).\nChest X-ray was normal, and chest CT revealed bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy with the largest node noted in the left axillary region measuring 2.1 x 1.2 cm and a 2 mm nodule noted in the right middle lobe. Skin punch biopsy showed the tattoo having sarcoid granuloma (Figure ).\nTissue culture for mycobacteria and fungi was negative. The patient was started on topical corticosteroid and then mycophenolate mofetil 2 g daily was added to the treatment, as the patient had recurrent uveitis and the patient's symptoms improved after starting mycophenolate mofetil.",

He presented for 2 years chronic watery diarrhea (7 to 10 times/day) without vomiting, abdominal pain, or rectorrhagia. The diarrhea was unresponsive to normal antidiarrheal agents. He had anorexia and unencrypted weight loss. The abdominal ultrasound showed a metastatic nodular liver. It was then completed with liver biopsy puncture. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed: hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine carcinoma with cells strongly expressing chromogranin A and weakly AFP.\nInformed consent was taken from the patient before the study.\nContrasted computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a heterogeneous mass in the head of the pancreas, with multiple hypodense hepatic nodules measuring between 11 and 38 mm.\nColonoscopy was normal and microscopy showed ulcerated bulbitis. Chemotherapy was indicated but the patient refused it. Six months later, the patient had developed polyuro polydipsic syndrome, diarrhea persisted, and his condition worsened, he had therefore benefited of a cure of chemotherapy: vinblastine 450 mg per day and cysplatine 150 mg per day. He was also treated with Sandostatine and Minirin 0.3ml three times a day. The symptoms were initially improved and then recurred.\nTherefore, the patient was transferred to our service. He was asthenic, bedridden and had signs of intra and extra cellular dehydration. His blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg and his pulse was 80 bpm. His weight was 39kg with a body mass index 14 kg per m2. His physical exam showed no other anomalies. He had clinical euthyroidism and eucorticism.\nBiological findings were: hyponatrémia (119 mmol/l) kypokalémia (2.31mmol) hypocalcémia (1.96 mmol/l) and metabolic acidosis. His kaliuresis was 32.55mmol/24h. The plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) level was 216 ng/ml. The diagnosis retained was vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-secreting tumor (VIPoma) with liver metastases.\nThe patient was urgently rehydrated with potassic supplementation through a supraclavicular central venous catheter and treated with Minirin 0.3 ml* 2 per day, calcium gluconate 16g/24 hand somatostatin analogues. The evolution was marked by the improvement of potassium levels, the degression of polyuro polydipsic syndrome which was due to hypokalemia and the persistence of diarrhea which became less abundant.\nDuring hospitalization, the patient developed a pulmonary embolism treated with curative doses of anticoagulants, and a catheter-related bloodstream infection, requiring the removal of the catheter and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nThe option of palliative surgery was discussed but eliminated because of the poor general health condition of the patient. He was then transferred to the carcinology department to receive a chemotherapy cure. The patient was lost to follow-up.",

He presented for 2 years chronic watery diarrhea (7 to 10 times/day) without vomiting, abdominal pain, or rectorrhagia. The diarrhea was unresponsive to normal antidiarrheal agents. He had anorexia and unencrypted weight loss. The abdominal ultrasound showed a metastatic nodular liver. It was then completed with liver biopsy puncture. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed: hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine carcinoma with cells strongly expressing chromogranin A and weakly AFP.\nInformed consent was taken from the patient before the study.\nContrasted computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a heterogeneous mass in the head of the pancreas, with multiple hypodense hepatic nodules measuring between 11 and 38 mm.\nColonoscopy was normal and microscopy showed ulcerated bulbitis. Chemotherapy was indicated but the patient refused it. Six months later, the patient had developed polyuro polydipsic syndrome, diarrhea persisted, and his condition worsened, he had therefore benefited of a cure of chemotherapy: vinblastine 450 mg per day and cysplatine 150 mg per day. He was also treated with Sandostatine and Minirin 0.3ml three times a day. The symptoms were initially improved and then recurred.\nTherefore, the patient was transferred to our service. He was asthenic, bedridden and had signs of intra and extra cellular dehydration. His blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg and his pulse was 80 bpm. His weight was 39kg with a body mass index 14 kg per m2. His physical exam showed no other anomalies. He had clinical euthyroidism and eucorticism.\nBiological findings were: hyponatrémia (119 mmol/l) kypokalémia (2.31mmol) hypocalcémia (1.96 mmol/l) and metabolic acidosis. His kaliuresis was 32.55mmol/24h. The plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) level was 216 ng/ml. The diagnosis retained was vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-secreting tumor (VIPoma) with liver metastases.\nThe patient was urgently rehydrated with potassic supplementation through a supraclavicular central venous catheter and treated with Minirin 0.3 ml* 2 per day, calcium gluconate 16g/24 hand somatostatin analogues. The evolution was marked by the improvement of potassium levels, the degression of polyuro polydipsic syndrome which was due to hypokalemia and the persistence of diarrhea which became less abundant.\nDuring hospitalization, the patient developed a pulmonary embolism treated with curative doses of anticoagulants, and a catheter-related bloodstream infection, requiring the removal of the catheter and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nThe option of palliative surgery was discussed but eliminated because of the poor general health condition of the patient. He was then transferred to the carcinology department to receive a chemotherapy cure. The patient was lost to follow-up.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 10.5-year-old boy presented with enlargement of the left breast tissue (Figure 1). His medical and family history was unremarkable. Breast development was first noticed 1.5 years before presentation. At the time of admission, his height was 136.4 cm (SD score:-0.50), weight was 27.2 kg (SD score:-1.29) and BMI was 14.6 kg/m2 (SD score:-1.43). There was no any other pathological finding on physical examination. His testes size was 2 mLx2 mL bilaterally. Axillary and pubic hair stages were prepubertal. He had grade 3-4 breast development on the left side, with normal contralateral breast tissue (according to the adapted classification by The American Society of Plastic Surgeons). There was no acceleration in somatic growth and bone age (bone age was 8 years). Hormonal evaluation, liver and renal function tests were normal (). Scrotal, abdominal and contralateral pectoral muscle US findings were normal as well. Breast US showed a fibroglandular tissue 40x10 mm in size, without any cystic or solid mass. This patient was also considered as a case of idiopathic unilateral prepubertal gynecomastia.\nBoth patients were also found to be in a depressed mood and with feelings of social isolation due to concerns about their feminine appearance. Therefore, a surgical excision was decided as the treatment of choice in both cases.\nSurgical Therapy\nSurgical resection was performed with peripheral liposuction technique with no perioperative complications. In addition, a remarkable improvement was observed in the psychological state of both patients at the post-surgical 6-month follow-up visit. There was also no evidence of recurrence ().\nHistopathologic and Immunohistochemical (IHC) Findings of the Specimens Obtained at Surgery\nThe histopathological examinations of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast materials processed with standard methods and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immune peroxidase (CK5/6 and P63) revealed benign fibroglandular gynecomastia with no evidence of any pathological finding ().\nFor IHC examination, consecutive sections were processed. To show ER protein expression on IHC, paraffin-embedded sections, obtained from the 4 μm thick sections, were processed by standard methods, using primary monoclonal antibody (ER, Clone 6F11, Leica Microsystems Inc., IL, US) and Mayer’s hematoxylin protocol. IHC examination showed an intensive (3+) cytosolic and nuclear staining of estrogen receptor in 100% of periductal epithelial cells ().",

His medical and family history was unremarkable. Breast development was first noticed 1.5 years before presentation. At the time of admission, his height was 136.4 cm (SD score:-0.50), weight was 27.2 kg (SD score:-1.29) and BMI was 14.6 kg/m2 (SD score:-1.43). There was no any other pathological finding on physical examination. His testes size was 2 mLx2 mL bilaterally. Axillary and pubic hair stages were prepubertal. He had grade 3-4 breast development on the left side, with normal contralateral breast tissue (according to the adapted classification by The American Society of Plastic Surgeons). There was no acceleration in somatic growth and bone age (bone age was 8 years). Hormonal evaluation, liver and renal function tests were normal (). Scrotal, abdominal and contralateral pectoral muscle US findings were normal as well. Breast US showed a fibroglandular tissue 40x10 mm in size, without any cystic or solid mass. This patient was also considered as a case of idiopathic unilateral prepubertal gynecomastia.\nBoth patients were also found to be in a depressed mood and with feelings of social isolation due to concerns about their feminine appearance. Therefore, a surgical excision was decided as the treatment of choice in both cases.\nSurgical Therapy\nSurgical resection was performed with peripheral liposuction technique with no perioperative complications. In addition, a remarkable improvement was observed in the psychological state of both patients at the post-surgical 6-month follow-up visit. There was also no evidence of recurrence ().\nHistopathologic and Immunohistochemical (IHC) Findings of the Specimens Obtained at Surgery\nThe histopathological examinations of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast materials processed with standard methods and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immune peroxidase (CK5/6 and P63) revealed benign fibroglandular gynecomastia with no evidence of any pathological finding ().\nFor IHC examination, consecutive sections were processed. To show ER protein expression on IHC, paraffin-embedded sections, obtained from the 4 μm thick sections, were processed by standard methods, using primary monoclonal antibody (ER, Clone 6F11, Leica Microsystems Inc., IL, US) and Mayer’s hematoxylin protocol. IHC examination showed an intensive (3+) cytosolic and nuclear staining of estrogen receptor in 100% of periductal epithelial cells ().''' \n\n output:"

She also had a large hiatal hernia (> 50% of the stomach was in the chest), which was the initial cause of her hospitalization. She had been treated for depression with duloxetine, a SNRI (extended release), 60 mg (0.6 mg/kg) twice daily for two years as an outpatient. She was subject to progressive exertional breathlessness, which was attributed to the combination of hiatal hernia, COPD/asthma, and obesity. She was hospitalized, and a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair (Toupet antireflux fundoplication and gastropexy) was performed.\nPostoperative day (POD) 0 to 12: the patient returned to the operating room on POD 1 due to recurrence of the hiatal hernia and the development of extensive pneumomediastinum. A torn suture and associated small tear in the stomach were identified. The fundoplication was taken down and redone.\nThe CAM-ICU was negative on POD 0 to 5 and 7 to 8, not recorded on POD 10 to 12, and positive on POD 6. The patient had an endotracheal tube for positive pressure mechanical ventilation removed on POD 2, reinserted on POD 5, removed on POD 6,and reinserted on POD 12. She was reported to have received duloxetine (120 mg, orally) on POD 0 and 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. However, she was subject to frequent bouts of emesis due to gastroparesis, and it is unclear how much of the drug was absorbed. On POD 12 emesis resulted in aspiration, which caused respiratory failure, reintubation, and emergent readmission to the ICU. She had been sedated with dexmedetomidine on POD 0, 1, and 2, propofol on POD 5, and both medications and restraints were required on POD 12 for stabilization of the patient in the ICU. Propofol was initially discontinued on POD 13. During this admission to the ICU she was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.\nThe CAM-ICU was positive on POD 13 to 25 except for POD 16, 23, and 24 when it was not recorded. She required sedation (various combinations of dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and midazolam; see for details) for agitation from POD 13 to 25. On POD 20 these sedating drugs were insufficient, and propofol was needed to prevent unplanned extubation. During POD 13 to 24 the patient could not tolerate pressure support spontaneous breathing trials. Her appearance was described by the respiratory therapists as “frantic” or “panicked” when they attempted to determine the rapid shallow breathing index. Duloxetine was not given as POD 13. However, due to concern for SNRI ADDS, on POD 20 the contents of the duloxetine capsule were crushed for administration, but the duloxetine pellets would not pass through the nasogastric tube. However, another SNRI, venlafaxine (crushed 75 mg tablet immediate release), which was able to pass via the nasogastric tube, was administered three times daily. As the daily dose of venlafaxine was increased, the doses of the sedating drugs required to prevent unplanned extubation were reduced; until by POD 25 these agents were completely discontinued, and the patient was liberated from mechanical ventilation.\nOn POD 28 to 36 the CAM-ICU was negative. The patient was not agitated or confused. She remained on venlafaxine and received lorazepam (1 mg orally) on POD 33, 35, and 36 for sleep. Otherwise she did not require medication for pain, agitation, or delirium, and she was transferred out of the ICU.",

        "patient": "A 36-year-old male with an unremarkable medical history presented to the ophthalmology service with a 1-month history of a congested and painful left eye accompanied by a persistent left-sided headache. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 for both eyes and an intraocular pressure of 20 and 15 mmHg for the right and left eyes, respectively. Biomicroscopy revealed significant conjunctival injection with engorged vessels in the temporal aspect of the patient’s left eye (Fig. a), which did not blanch after instillation of 10% phenylephrine. The cornea was clear, and 3+ cells were visualized in the left anterior chamber. The results of a dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. Laboratory studies demonstrated an elevated C-reactive protein level (25.7 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 mm/h). A thorough rheumatologic evaluation was unrevealing, and the following tests were normal, including total and differential white blood cell counts, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serology for syphilis and chest X-ray. A diagnosis of scleritis was made, and the patient received 40 mg oral prednisolone daily and topical 1% prednisolone 4 times daily. Though the ocular symptoms improved, the resolution was incomplete.\nFour weeks later, the patient was referred to the dermatology service because physical examination revealed a rapidly-growing erythematous soft lobulated nodule (1.5 × 1.3 cm) on the right side of the patient’s face (Fig. b). An incisional biopsy specimen was obtained, and the pathological findings showed dense diffuse nodular infiltrate of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes with S-100 positivity mixed with neutrophils throughout the upper two-thirds of the dermis, which was consistent with atypical Rosai-Dorfman disease with abundant neutrophils. The facial nodule continued to grow while the patient was maintained on low-dose prednisolone (5 mg daily). Although intralesional triamcinolone injections were performed weekly for 5 weeks, the tumor continued to enlarge to 4 × 2.5 cm, so excision of the facial skin tumor was performed. The pathological diagnosis was RDD with excessive Demodex mites. The maintenance therapy included prednisolone and doxycycline along with prn intralesional triamcinolone injections.\nTwo months after the skin surgery, a painless, fixed, pink subconjunctival nodule was noted in the inferior-temporal aspect of his left eye (Fig. c), and surgical excision was scheduled. Pathological examination of the specimen demonstrated histiocytes with emperipolesis, cytoplasmic and nuclear S100 positivity, and a negative stain for CD1a, which were also compatible with RDD (Fig. a-d). In addition, 1 week after the ocular surgery, multiple discrete and confluent papulonodules rapidly evolved over the bilateral cheek, ear and scalp. Oral dapsone 100 mg daily was administered for 6 weeks and was then switched to methotrexate (MTX) 10 mg once weekly due to poor response. The patient underwent another excision of the tumor on the right side of his face and intermittent intralesional triamcinolone injections. Finally, the lesions gradually flattened, and MTX was then slowly tapered to a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg per week after 4 months. At the 24-month follow-up, there were no signs of recurrence of the epibulbar tumor and facial mass or of involvement of other sites (Fig. d).",

Ophthalmologic examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 for both eyes and an intraocular pressure of 20 and 15 mmHg for the right and left eyes, respectively. Biomicroscopy revealed significant conjunctival injection with engorged vessels in the temporal aspect of the patient’s left eye (Fig. a), which did not blanch after instillation of 10% phenylephrine. The cornea was clear, and 3+ cells were visualized in the left anterior chamber. The results of a dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. Laboratory studies demonstrated an elevated C-reactive protein level (25.7 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 mm/h). A thorough rheumatologic evaluation was unrevealing, and the following tests were normal, including total and differential white blood cell counts, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serology for syphilis and chest X-ray. A diagnosis of scleritis was made, and the patient received 40 mg oral prednisolone daily and topical 1% prednisolone 4 times daily. Though the ocular symptoms improved, the resolution was incomplete.\nFour weeks later, the patient was referred to the dermatology service because physical examination revealed a rapidly-growing erythematous soft lobulated nodule (1.5 × 1.3 cm) on the right side of the patient’s face (Fig. b). An incisional biopsy specimen was obtained, and the pathological findings showed dense diffuse nodular infiltrate of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes with S-100 positivity mixed with neutrophils throughout the upper two-thirds of the dermis, which was consistent with atypical Rosai-Dorfman disease with abundant neutrophils. The facial nodule continued to grow while the patient was maintained on low-dose prednisolone (5 mg daily). Although intralesional triamcinolone injections were performed weekly for 5 weeks, the tumor continued to enlarge to 4 × 2.5 cm, so excision of the facial skin tumor was performed. The pathological diagnosis was RDD with excessive Demodex mites. The maintenance therapy included prednisolone and doxycycline along with prn intralesional triamcinolone injections.\nTwo months after the skin surgery, a painless, fixed, pink subconjunctival nodule was noted in the inferior-temporal aspect of his left eye (Fig. c), and surgical excision was scheduled. Pathological examination of the specimen demonstrated histiocytes with emperipolesis, cytoplasmic and nuclear S100 positivity, and a negative stain for CD1a, which were also compatible with RDD (Fig. a-d). In addition, 1 week after the ocular surgery, multiple discrete and confluent papulonodules rapidly evolved over the bilateral cheek, ear and scalp. Oral dapsone 100 mg daily was administered for 6 weeks and was then switched to methotrexate (MTX) 10 mg once weekly due to poor response. The patient underwent another excision of the tumor on the right side of his face and intermittent intralesional triamcinolone injections. Finally, the lesions gradually flattened, and MTX was then slowly tapered to a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg per week after 4 months. At the 24-month follow-up, there were no signs of recurrence of the epibulbar tumor and facial mass or of involvement of other sites (Fig. d).''' \n\n output:"

The patient denied having any recent abdominal trauma, vomiting or diarrhea, and menarche had occurred at age 12 years. She was not sexually active and under any medical treatment. The laboratory tests including complete blood count, tumor markers, and beta human chorionic gonadotropin were within normal ranges. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed absence of the left kidney and a cystic mass adjacent to the uterus that filled the left half of the pelvis. The uterus was of normal size and shape with myometrium, cervix, and vagina. The abdominopelvic MRI scan demonstrated an enlarged mass consistent with hematometrocolpos, a uterus didelphys, along with left renal agenesis (, ). In the hospital where she was first admitted, a suprapubic catheter was placed into the left obstructed hemi-vagina under ultrasound guidance by the department of interventional radiology. Although the hematometrocolpos was drained, it was not a definitive treatment. On admission to our clinic, she had no pain but a suprapubic catheter that was sutured to skin. The external genitalia were normal. After the patient and her family were informed, vaginal examination was performed under general anesthesia. Vaginoscopy and hysteroscopy were performed in the lithotomy position without hymenotomy. The left hemi-vagina was blunt. After clear visualization of the right vagina, the vaginal septum was dissected using a hysteroscopic unipolar needle electrode. The left hemi-vaginal and uterine cavities were observed, along with the suprapubic drainage catheter (). The supra-pubic catheter placed in the left obstructed hemi-vagina was gently removed. The vaginal septum was then dissected longitudinally using a unipolar needle electrode. After dissection, a 3-cm gap in the vaginal septum was obtained, which allowed drainage from the left uterine cavity (). The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged from hospital the next day. The first follow-up visit was four weeks after the operation.

        "title": "Treatment Considerations for Patients with Unresectable Metastatic Melanoma Who Develop Pembrolizumab-Induced Guillain-Barré Toxicity: A Case Report",
        "patient": "The patient is a 65-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented to the Oncology Department with a newly diagnosed malignant melanoma first noticed on a screening mammogram. She underwent core needle biopsy of a right-sided breast nodule that confirmed the diagnosis. Staging PET scan revealed several FDG-avid subcutaneous nodules in the chest, right flank, and right upper arm and an excisional biopsy of one of these lesions confirmed metastatic disease. Her melanoma was BRAF/CKIT/NRAS negative. She started treatment with pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks.\nWithin a few hours of completing her second cycle of pembrolizumab, she reported an ascending numbness in her feet and ankles bilaterally that radiated up to her knees. The patient subsequently underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging that was negative. Unfortunately, due to worsening symptoms, which now included lower extremity muscle weakness with gait instability, left hand weakness, and left tongue numbness, she had a neurological evaluation that raised suspicion of an immunotherapy-associated neuropathy. She presented back to our oncology clinic where it was determined that she required admission for worsening neurological symptoms. Her physical exam on admission was notable for 4/5 strength of the left upper extremity with weaknesses in arm abduction at the shoulder, elbow extension/flexion, hand grip and finger flexion. She also had 4/5 strength with left foot plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Reflexes were diminished at the biceps and brachioradialis bilaterally and nonexistent in the patellar and Achilles tendon bilaterally. Her tandem gait was unsteady, but Romberg was negative. She also had diminished facial sensation along the left V1 distribution.\nDuring her hospitalization, her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed clear appearance with a normal glucose (63 mg/dL), 17/mm3 nucleated cells, 42/mm3 red blood cells with an elevated protein level (total protein 78 mg/dL [normal range: 15–45]), albumin 43.3 mg/dL (normal range: <27), with the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF. Testing for anti-ganglioside and anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein was negative. A nerve conduction study during this admission was not suggestive of neuropathy either. However, given the clinical suspicion for GBS, she received treatment with 5 days of IVIG, leading to a significant improvement in her muscle weakness. Unfortunately, 18 days after discharge, she developed an ascending paralysis of her upper and lower extremities that was complicated by a fall, which resulted in an ankle fracture and a newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism. On this admission, she received plasma exchange for 7 days and intravenous solumedrol for 5 days, instead of IVIG. This time, the plan was to discharge her on a slow taper of oral prednisone. After seeing some improvement in her symptoms, she was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility and eventually went home. However, 44 days after her second admission, she was re-admitted for worsening ascending paralysis complicated by spasticity in her toes and fingers. A repeat nerve conduction study on this admission showed slowing of waveforms that was suggestive of an acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed with CSF analysis showing clear appearance with a normal glucose (62 mg/dL), 3/mm3 nucleated cells, 0/mm3 red blood cells with an elevated protein level (total protein 175 mg/dL [normal range: 15–45]), albumin 96.9 mg/dL (normal range: <27), and IgG 10.8 mg/dL (normal range: <8.1) but no oligoclonal bands. Testing for leukemia and lymphoma in the CSF was negative. She once again received 7 days of plasma exchange and 5 days of intravenous solumedrol but was discharged on a higher dose of oral prednisone than before and a planned taper over the course of many weeks. In addition to this, she received periodic plasma exchanges as an outpatient.\nDue to the development of Guillain-Barré-like neuropathy, pembrolizumab was stopped and her melanoma was followed with PET scans every 2 months. After initially showing a mixed response, progression occurred about 1 year after her last dose of pembrolizumab. This included several new subcutaneous nodules and a new brain lesion for which she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. After a long discussion about the risks and benefits of re-challenging with a different class of immunotherapy, the patient agreed to start with ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor. She only received 1 dose of ipilimumab with PET scans showing a significant and sustained response nearly 1 year later. Her only reported symptoms after receiving ipilimumab were diarrhea and ongoing bilateral leg tingling. She remains on a low dose of steroids at this time but has not had any re-occurrence of her Guillain-Barré-like neuropathy.",

He was diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis and started on heparin. On X-rays & CT scan (, ), he was diagnosed to have bilateral acetabular fracture and three part left proximal humerus fracture. He was operated for bilateral acetabular fracture using modified Stoppa’s approach and fixed with buttress plate in true pelvis on both sides (). On post op day 3, he had fever & discharge from suture site, dressing was done and pus culture and sensitivity done. Wound wash was done to eradicate infection. Culture showed growth of Klebsiella and anaerobes sensitive to cefoperazone sulbactum, clindamycin and amikacin. The pus discharge resumed again after 3 days of wound wash and antibiotics. This time culture sensitivity tests showed resistance to cefoperazone sulbactum so chloremphenical was started which decreased the pus discharge but could not stop it. Based on the sensitivity tests, meropenem was started which stopped the discharge for 5 days then again the discharge started. At this time about 2 weeks after the first surgery, it was decided to start irrigation with Qurion solution for an hour and then continue Vacumn assisted suction (VAS). At both ends of the suture line single stitches were removed, at one end infant feeding tube was put for irrigation with qurion solution and at the other end infant feeding tube inserted for vacuum assisted suction (). Daily Qurion irrigation was done in morning and evening for one hour during which vacuum assisted suction was stopped. After one hour again vacuum assisted suction was started. After 2 days of starting Qurion irrigation & vacuum assisted suction therpy (QiVAS), the suture site became dry. We continued QiVAS therapy for 2 weeks with antibiotic meropenem.

        "patient": "A 71-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension, arthritis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and osteoarthritis presented to the emergency room with complaints of intermittent fever, chills, generalized weakness, myalagia, and malaise of two weeks duration. He also complained of dysuria and intermittent right-sided subcostal pleuritic pain. He denied diarrhea, melena, any recent travels, or any sick contacts. On physical examination, patient had a temperature of 36.7ºC, was hypotensive initially with systolic blood pressure in the 70s-80s; however, with aggressive fluid resuscitation, his blood pressure came up and was recorded as 98/52 on admission. His pulse was 90 and respiratory rate was 18 saturating 98% on room air. Remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Pt was anicteric. Lungs were clear on auscultation. Cardiac examination findings were normal. Abdomen was soft, with active bowel sounds. No significant tenderness, guarding or rigidity was elicited in the right upper quadrant of abdomen. There was no costorenal tenderness. Initial laboratory testing revealed a WBC count of 36.6*1000 with bands of 7%; creatinine was 2.1, BUN 54, AST 84, ALT 51, alkaline phosphatase 182, total bilirubin 2.5, direct bilirubin 1.3, albumin 1.7, total protein 5.5, PT 15.1, PTT 38, and INR 1.5. Urinalysis was positive for large leukocyte esterase with marked pyuria of more than 60/HPF. The chest X-ray was unremarkable.\nPatient was started on empiric intravenous antibiotics with Ampicillin-Sulbactam, and blood and urine cultures were sent. In view of his complaint of intermittent right-sided sub costal pain and a negative chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound was obtained. Interestingly, the ultrasound revealed heterogenous liver masses and associated partial main portal vein thrombosis. To further characterize these findings, a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was performed []. The CT scan showed multiple low-density liver lesions with enhancing rims as well as perihepatic fluid collections suggestive of multiple hepatic abscesses. There was also associated partial main portal vein thrombosis and right portal vein thrombosis. The presence of diverticulosis was noted as well. The finding of diverticulosis raised the possibility of diverticulitis as the source of infection; however, this could not be determined convincingly. After consultation with the surgeon and radiologist, CT guided drain was placed in the largest hepatic abscess with a view aimed at interval follow up of the lesions. In the meantime patient's blood culture revealed Streptococcus Anginosus (2/2), susceptible to penicillins. Patient continued to do well with mild discomfort intermittently in the right subcostal/ right upper abdominal quadrant. His leukocytosis overall improved with some fluctuations, but did not resolve. His creatinine levels normalised. His abdomen remained benign on examination. The hemodynamic parameters were stable. Repeat blood cultures did not show any growth and the cultures from hepatic abscess drain showed no growth as well. Surprisingly, a repeat CT scan done 6 days after the drain was placed showed that there was overall increased size of the intraparenchymal and extrahepatic abscesses. New interloop abscess were present in the right mid abdomen and in the pelvis. Right portal vein thrombosis was redemonstrated. In view of progression of the disease, decision was made for exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative findings were consistent with multiple intra-abdominal abscesses and adhesions. The sigmoid colon was noted to be completely adherent to the bladder with extensive fibrolytic area. This was consistent with Sigmoid Diverticulitis with the formation of a colovesical fistula. The patient underwent sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis, repair of the colovesical fistula, enterolysis, and drainage of multiple intraabdominal abscesses.\nPatient's postoperative course was unremarkable. He showed gradual recovery. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis done 6 days post surgery showed improvement in liver lesions. Patient was discharged home on hospital day 24 to complete a total 4-week course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. A follow-up CT scan done about 3 months later did not show any intra-abdominal or hepatic abscess.",

Two weeks later, the patient lost control of her left\nhand, mainly at night where upon waking her left hand was grasping her right\narm.\nSubsequently, her dominant hand presented extravolitional movements, as if having a\nwill of its own, not responding to volitional commands such as opening a door or\nholding an umbrella, but groping unneeded objects and having difficulty releasing\nthem. The patient often found her left hand closed, in front of her face, as if it\nwere “looking” at her. She was afraid of her hand: “it seemed to be a monster”. It\nalso scratched and hurt the patient’s face and body. She had talked to her hand and\neven fought it. Other clinical presentations including recent memory loss,\nhemineglect (patient deployed only half of visual field) and dysphoria in the\ncontext of depressed organic mood were also verified. On physical evaluation, the\npatient had central hemifacial palsy. These symptoms lasted for two weeks and had a\nsignificant impact on the patient’s life, disappearing only after etiological\ntreatment of toxoplasmosis.\nHemogram showed leucopenia, with lymphocytopenia. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation\nshowed slight cell increase, preponderance of mononuclear cells, elevated protein\nlevel, without glucose consumption. Serologies for cryptococcosis, syphilis,\nneurocysticercosis and cytomegalovirus were negative. Cranial computed tomography\nrevealed a hypodense area in the right frontal-parietal region with midline\ndeviation ().\nConsidering clinical, laboratorial and epidemiological data, CNS toxoplasmosis was\nthe most likely diagnosis. The patient was empirically treated with sulfadiazine,\npyrimethamine, hidantoine, amitriptyline, leucovorin, mannitol and dexamethasone.\nThis treatment was successful, confirming the hypothesis of Toxoplasmosis.

Other clinical presentations including recent memory loss,\nhemineglect (patient deployed only half of visual field) and dysphoria in the\ncontext of depressed organic mood were also verified. On physical evaluation, the\npatient had central hemifacial palsy. These symptoms lasted for two weeks and had a\nsignificant impact on the patient’s life, disappearing only after etiological\ntreatment of toxoplasmosis.\nHemogram showed leucopenia, with lymphocytopenia. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation\nshowed slight cell increase, preponderance of mononuclear cells, elevated protein\nlevel, without glucose consumption. Serologies for cryptococcosis, syphilis,\nneurocysticercosis and cytomegalovirus were negative. Cranial computed tomography\nrevealed a hypodense area in the right frontal-parietal region with midline\ndeviation ().\nConsidering clinical, laboratorial and epidemiological data, CNS toxoplasmosis was\nthe most likely diagnosis. The patient was empirically treated with sulfadiazine,\npyrimethamine, hidantoine, amitriptyline, leucovorin, mannitol and dexamethasone.\nThis treatment was successful, confirming the hypothesis of Toxoplasmosis. The\npatient evolved with progressive improvement of symptoms, including alien-hand signs\ndischarged from hospital.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "On March 26, 2016, a 27-year-old woman visited the infectious diseases outpatient department because of persistent arthralgias and rash. She works as a stewardess on a cruise ship and she stayed in Costa Rica for 2 months where she developed symptoms; then she returned to Croatia on March 21. Six months before this illness, she was vaccinated against yellow fever. She remembered a mosquito bite on her left forearm because she noticed a little hematoma around the indurated papule which she had not experienced after earlier mosquito bites. Five days after the mosquito bite, on the first day of her disease, she felt symmetrical arthralgias in her ankles, knees, wrists, and elbows but also in small joints of her hands and feet. The third day, she developed high fever up to 38.5°C with chills. Her arthralgias deteriorated, so she could hardly walk. On the fifth day of her illness, an itchy rash appeared on her trunk, and the next day it extended to her face, extremities, as well as palms and soles. The erythematous papular rash subsided in the next 2 days. At the same time, she became afebrile, while arthralgias remained up to the tenth day of her illness after which she was feeling well, but exhausted. During the acute phase of her illness, she had nausea and she had a few loose stools too. Ten days after she had recovered, severe arthralgias in her ankles, elbows, right shoulder, and in the small joints of hands and feet reappeared. She also complained about morning stiffness lasting for 10–30 min.\nOn the initial visit (day 15 after the disease onset), the physical examination was normal except for rash on the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles (). Routine laboratory tests were normal, except for slightly elevated liver transaminases, erythrocytes 4.35×1012/L (reference range [RR]: 3.86–5.08), leukocytes 8.4×109/L (RR: 83.4–9.7), lymphocytes 21.5% (RR: 20–46), C-reactive protein 1.3 mg/L (<5), platelets 219×109/L (RR: 158–424), BUN 5.4 mmol/L (RR: 2.8–8.3), creatinine 70 µmol/L (RR: 63–107), aspartate aminotransferase 32 U/L (RR: 8–30), alanine aminotransferase 51 U/L (RR: 10–36), γ-glutamyl transferase 21 U/L (RR: 9–35), and lactate dehydrogenase 196 U/L (RR: 25–241).\nAccording to the case definition proposed by the international chikungunya expert group (2015), which distinguishes 4 chikungunya case categories; acute clinical case, atypical case, severe acute case, and suspected and/or confirmed chronic case; our patient was classified as a confirmed chronic chikungunya case. The patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol. She was regularly followed up during the next few months in order to treat her arthralgias and also to observe the progress of her illness. Her symptoms ameliorated, but 3 months later she still reports arthralgias.\nDue to similar geographical distribution and clinical symptoms, the serum sample (taken on day 20) was initially tested for CHIKV IgM/IgG antibodies, using indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA; Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) as well as Zika virus (ZIKV) IgM/IgG and dengue virus (DENV) IgM/IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Euroimmun). To exclude potential cross reactivity with other arboviruses, the sample was additionally tested for West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) antibodies using ELISA (Euroimmun), as well as yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) using IFA (Euroimmun). Serology results are presented in . CHIKV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected with titre 1:100 and 1:10,000, respectively (). In addition, postvaccinal YFV IgG antibodies were found (titer 100). There was no cross reactivity with other tested arboviruses.\nIn addition, the sample was tested for the presence of CHIKV RNA using a qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to the protocol described by Smith et al. For nucleic acid isolation, an automated system QIAxtractor (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a single-tube RT-PCR test kit (Invitrogen SuperScript™III Platinum® One-Step Qualitative Kit; Carlsbad, CA, USA). The amplification and detection were performed with 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The test tube contained a 25-µL reaction mixture which included 5 µL of isolated RNA, 0.2 µM forward primer (CCGAAAGGAAACTTCAAAGCAACT), 0.2 µM reverse primer (CAGATGCCCGCCATTATTGAT), and 0.1 µM probe (FAM-GGGAGGTGGAGCATG-MGB). The reaction mixture was exposed to a 30 min 50°C reverse transcription step, 2 min of Taq activation at 95°C, and 50 cycles consisting of 95°C for 15 sec and 55°C for 32 sec. No CHIKV RNA was found in the tested sample. Sensitivity of the RT-PCR is reported to be high (0.3 plaque-forming units; PFU/mL), as is specificity (no cross reactivity with the most common alphaviruses that contained a minimum of 3 log10 PFU of heterologous viral RNA).",

The patient was treated with idarubicin plus etoposide and cytarabine with no hematologic response. Complete remission was subsequently obtained with a course of high-dose cytarabine, followed consolidation with 2 additional courses of high-dose cytarabine. An unrelated marrow donor search was started and a partially (one-antigen mismatched) HLA-matched donor was identified. The patient received mobilized donor HSCT after a conditioning regimen with Thiotepa (5 mg/kg/day for 2 days), Busulphan (3,2 mg/kg/day for 3 days) and Fludarabine (50 mg/kg/day for 3 days). GvHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine, short course methotrexate, and anti-thymocyte globulin ATG (2,5 mg/kg/day for 3 days). Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred on day +14 and +12 respectively. The patient experienced a transient skin rash suggestive of grade I acute GVHD on day +19, and 3 episodes of CMV reactivation on days +27,+ 43 and + 82 successfully treated with preemptive valganciclovir and immunoglobulins.\nThe patient was readmitted because of severe anemia and thrombocytopenia (Hb 5,8 gr/dl; platelet 5000/ul) and complaints of right abdominal pain with melena on day +89. Significant weight gain (+7 kg) along with abdominal distension and anasarca were observed on day +91. Laboratory exams showed total bilirubin 3,30 mg/dl, AST/ALT 140/164 UI, GGT 725 Ul, INR 1,7; aPTT 41,3″, serum creatinine 2,0 mg/dl; platelet count was 20.000/mmc. An abdominal CT scan revealed ascites and hepatic veins compression. Transjugular measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient showed severe sinusoidal portal hypertension with a significant transhepatic/caval gradient diagnostic for severe VOD. Transjugular liver biopsy showed sinusoidal dilation and bleeding with erythrocytes in the Disse space, and significant iron overload. Histology studies were consistent with severe VOD.\nIntravenous defibrotide was promptly started at the dose of 6.25 mg/kg QID for 22 days. Ancillary therapy included plasma and red blood cells transfusions, no steroid have been administered. A complete and sustained response was achieved. The patient was discharged on day +121.

Three weeks prior, the patient was hospitalized for a wound infection of her surgical site with wound cultures positive for pseudomonas and enterococcus. She subsequently underwent surgical debridement, incision and drainage, and was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam 4.6g every six hours.

At the rehabilitation facility, the patient’s daughter noted that the patient’s cognitive ability had continued to deteriorate since discharge from the hospital. The patient now had word-finding difficulty prompting an emergency department (ED) evaluation for a stroke. The vitals in the ED were within normal limits and the physical exam only remarkable for asterixis.

        "patient": "A 41-year-old Congolese woman, living in France for 5 years, was hospitalized for kidney injury. She had no medical history except for six uncomplicated pregnancies. Two months after her last delivery, she noticed general sickness, loss of weight and noctural fever. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory results were as follows: white cell 7 × 109/L, with lymphopenia 0.8 × 109/L; microcytic anaemia 80 g/L; C-reactive protein 68.5 mg/L; serum creatinine (SCr) 457 µmol/L; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration ( CKD-EPI) formula 10 mL/min/1.73 m2. Renal ultrasonography was normal. Urinalysis revealed low tubular proteinuria (0.6 g/g creatinine), sterile leucocyturia (250/mm3) and no haematuria. Renal biopsy showed diffuse active interstitial inflammation without granulomas (Figure ).\nThe first aetiological assessment was inconclusive: no drug abuse (including over-the-counter medications), negative hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses serologies, negative blood and urine cultures, normal chest X-ray, cardiac ultrasound and no immunologic antibodies (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody, anti-RO/SSa and anti-La/SSb were negative). Complement was not activated. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was normal.\nThe patient was initially treated with IV methylprednisolone (500 mg/day for 3 days), followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), which was gradually tapered off. A first interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), using QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-TB) testing (Qiagen), was performed and considered indeterminate due to no reactivity in the mitogen control positive well. Due to a high suspicion of TB, antitubercular treatment was introduced 3 weeks later.\nAs the fever persisted, investigations were intensified: ‘Ziehl–Neelsen’ staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture on renal biopsy; two early morning urine cultures were performed and gave negative results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb). Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) showed uptakes in stomach, ileocecal valve and two mediastinal lymph nodes (Figure ). A transbronchial biopsy of one mediastinal node showed granuloma formations with central necrosis, whereas PCR was negative for MTb. Finally, after 4 weeks, MTb grew in lymph node. Once corticotherapy was decreased, a second QFT-TB assay was performed and the result was then positive. Six months later, fever and biological inflammation reduced, while renal function remained at Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (SCr 508 μmol/L, eGFR 8 mL/min/1.73 m2).

        "patient": "A 27-year-old woman visited our gynecology department because of abdominal pain and genital bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass in the left retrorectal area, and she was referred to our department for detailed examinations and treatment. Her medical history was unremarkable. Her laboratory results, including serum tumor biomarkers, such as α-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinogenic embryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), were within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 3-cm-sized multilocular cystic mass in the anterior sacrum on the left dorsal side of the rectum. The mass showed a gradual contrast effect on the margin and was suspected to have a solid component. No obvious calcification was observed (Fig. ). MRI showed no obvious fat in the area (Fig. ). Fluorodeoxyglucose-position emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed no abnormal uptake. Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no abnormalities in the rectal mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a 3-cm-sized extraintestinal cyst near the rectum. No obvious calcification was found inside (Fig. ).\nWith the above tests, it was difficult to confirm the preoperative diagnosis of the presacral cystic mass. Teratoma, tailgut cyst, dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, etc., were considered in the differential diagnosis. Because there have been reports of malignant cases, we decided to perform surgical mass removal as a diagnostic treatment.\nThe operation was conducted with the patient in the jack-knife position. A skin incision measuring approximately 3 cm was made from the coccyx to the anus. We made an incision in the mural fascia to reach the tumor and enable detachment without damaging the tumor. Since it was difficult to confirm the deep part of the tumor through direct visualization, we attached a GelPOINT® Path (Applied Medical, USA) placed two 10-mm trocars and a AirSEAL® (CONMED, USA) trocar in a triangular fashion to the incision and insufflated it at 12 mmHg with the AirSEAL® System to remove the tumor endoscopically while confirming the boundary between the tumor and the anterior coccyx/posterior rectal wall. The operative time was 171 min, with minimal blood loss (Fig. ).\nHistopathological examination revealed a benign mature teratoma (Fig. ). She did not have any complications and was discharged from our hospital 5 days after the surgery. Seven months later, she had no tumor recurrence or residual symptoms.",

A skin incision measuring approximately 3 cm was made from the coccyx to the anus. We made an incision in the mural fascia to reach the tumor and enable detachment without damaging the tumor. Since it was difficult to confirm the deep part of the tumor through direct visualization, we attached a GelPOINT® Path (Applied Medical, USA) placed two 10-mm trocars and a AirSEAL® (CONMED, USA) trocar in a triangular fashion to the incision and insufflated it at 12 mmHg with the AirSEAL® System to remove the tumor endoscopically while confirming the boundary between the tumor and the anterior coccyx/posterior rectal wall. The operative time was 171 min, with minimal blood loss (Fig. ).\nHistopathological examination revealed a benign mature teratoma (Fig. ). She did not have any complications and was discharged from our hospital 5 days after the surgery. Seven months later, she had no tumor recurrence or residual symptoms.''' \n\n output:"

Her past medical history was significant for 50 pack-year smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Pre-operative chest X-ray revealed an abnormal shadow of 4.1 cm on the left lung. Chest computer tomography (CT) scan revealed a 3.6 cm soft tissue mass in the anterior lingula (). Few days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness and dizziness. Laboratory workup showed sodium level 115 mmol/L, serum osmolality 248 mOsm/kg, urine sodium level 106 mmol/L, urine osmolality 554 mOsm/kg, and serum cortisol level 31 µg/dL (normal: 3.4 - 22.5). The patient had normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Random blood glucose was 150 mg/dL. Serum uric acid was 3.2 mg/dL (normal 2.6 - 5.9). The hyponatremia was initially felt to be due to volume depletion in setting of decreased oral intake, use of hydrochlorothiazide, vomiting and diarrhea. However, her serum sodium (Na) level did not improve with volume repletion with normal saline but decreased even further to 114 mmol/L. Normal saline infusion was discontinued and fluid restriction was implemented. The serum Na level remained low despite fluid restriction and use of sodium chloride tablets and furosemide. Subsequently the patient received one dose of tolvaptan and her serum Na level increased to 125 mmol/L. Further management included continuing tolvaptan and oral sodium tablets and furosemide and gradual correction of Na level. Later lung biopsy was done and results showed small basophilic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio resembling small cell carcinoma (). However, immunohistochemical studies showed positivity for cytokeratin 5/6, p40, and CD56. TTF-1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and neuron specific enolase were negative. A final diagnosis of BSQCC was made. The patient had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which showed no evidence of metastasis.

        "patient": "A 25-year-old woman from Sayaya village in Katsina State, northwestern Nigeria, presented to our eye clinic with a three-month history of redness, pain, photophobia, tearing, and itching, and a two-month history of gradual loss of vision with a sensation of a moving object in the left eye. There was no history of fever, itching, or swelling in any part of the body. She resides in a village which is located close to a hydro-irrigation dam and has never traveled out of the savanna belt of northern Nigeria. She is a full-time housewife, while her husband is a farmer. She had visited a couple of primary health care centres over the last four months and was prescribed topical eye medications with no improvement.\nExamination revealed a healthy-looking but anxious patient without subcutaneous nodules or swelling on any part of the body, suggesting no lymphadenopathy. Chest and heart were essentially normal, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly.\nThe left eye examination revealed a visual acuity of light perception, conjunctival hyperemia, a clear cornea, and a live and active thread-like worm in the anterior chamber (). The anterior chamber was lined by fibrinous membrane that occluded the pupil. The pupil was irregular, with 360 degree posterior synechia that was associated with a cataract. No abnormality was found in the surrounding ocular adnexa. Right eye examination revealed a visual acuity of 6/5 and normal anterior segment. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg and 14 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively, using pulse air tonometry. Ocular B-Scan showed vitreous opacities in the left eye.\nFull blood count revealed 52% eosinophilia, but multiple midday samples of peripheral blood were negative for microfilaria, and no skin snip examination was done. Stool microscopy did not show any ova or parasites. The patient was admitted for surgical removal of the worm after obtaining consent. While the patient was under local retrobular anesthesia with 2% xylocaine, an operating microscope was used to remove the fully intact worm from the anterior chamber through a superotemporal limbal stab incision. Subconjunctival injections of dexamethasone and ofloxacin were administered four times per day and atropine eye drops 0.5% twice daily. The doses of topical steroid were tapered down over two months. Laboratory analysis of the worm specimen (fixed in carnoy and stained with Giemsa and haemotoxylin), measured 2.3 cm by 0.4 mm. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of a funnel-shaped mouth in the anterior region and the ventral curvature of the tail region (). These morphologic taxonomic features are characteristic for adult male L. loa. The size of the worm was less than the normal range of 3.0–3.4 cm for an adult male L. loa; this may be explained by the shrinkage that could have occurred prior to microscopic examination.\nThe patient was treated with oral Albendazole 400 mg daily for 21 days and was followed up closely at the outpatient clinic. The vision in the affected eye deteriorated to no perception of light.",

An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed prior to referral though this showed no evidence of any pathology. The patient was a non-smoker with no history of drug abuse, previous heart surgery, recent invasive procedures, or dental intervention.\nPhysical examination at presentation was unremarkable with no signs of infection and normal vital signs. Laboratory tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 82 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 60 mm/h), but otherwise normal complete blood count, renal, liver, and thyroid function. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 82 b.p.m. with no evidence of atrioventricular block. Urinalysis showed microscopic haematuria. Three sets of blood cultures revealed the growth of coagulase-negative gram-positive cocci. The patient was subsequently started on intravenous teicoplanin at a loading dose of 1 g every 12 h for three doses.\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed a bicuspid, calcified aortic valve, and a dilated aortic root with a dilated and asymmetric sinus of Valsalva and sinotubular junction () (, Videos S and S). Moderate, eccentric aortic regurgitation was also present (, Video S). The aortic root diameter measured 4.8 cm with an aortic root area of 10.8 cm2, and the mean gradient across the aortic valve was 10.7 mmHg with a peak gradient of 19.2 mmHg.\nAt this point, the blood culture and sensitivity report confirmed the growth of Staphylococcus lugdunensis sensitive to flucloxacillin. Hence antibiotics were switched to intravenous flucloxacillin 2 g every 6 h.\nA transoesophageal echocardiography was performed, which revealed an aortic root abscess surrounding a dilated aortic root and a bicuspid aortic valve with severe regurgitation through both the leaflet coaptation site and the abscess cavity () (, Videos S and S). No vegetations were seen on the valve. Left ventricular systolic function was normal.\nA cardiac CT was then performed for further evaluation, which showed a dilated ascending aorta with a maximum diameter of 45 mm, an aortic root abscess in the left ventricular outflow tract below the level of the aortic valve annulus dissecting caudally into the anterior mitral valve leaflet and cranially up the wall of the ascending aorta along its posterior aspect (about 1 cm in depth), and a bicuspid aortic valve with severe calcification of the leaflets (). Mild stenosis at the mid-left anterior descending artery due to a calcified plaque was also present (, ).\nThe patient was then referred for urgent debridement of the abscess and replacement of the valve with tissue prosthesis using 29 mm Magna Ease valve. The abscess cavity was patched with bovine pericardial tissue. Histopathologic evaluation of the excised valvular tissue confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.\nPost-operatively, the patient made an excellent recovery with a well-healed sternotomy and a good exercise tolerance. A repeat transoesophageal echocardiogram was satisfactory showing no complications with the patch, and antibiotics were switched to intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g once daily to reduce the frequency of administration and facilitate mobilization. The patient received a total of 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics.\nA repeat transthoracic echocardiogram performed 3 weeks post-aortic valve replacement showed a well-seated prosthetic tissue valve with a peak gradient of 18 mmHg, and good global left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 60% (, Video S).",

        "title": "Primary rectal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in a patient with previously identified primary biliary cirrhosis and secondary Sjögren’s syndrome",
        "patient": "In 1993, a 62-year-old female was referred from her primary doctor for further evaluation for Raynaud’s symptoms and abnormal hepatic function. She showed positive results for anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (AMA-M2) at 59.8 index, and although liver biopsy revealed no evidence of chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis, was diagnosed with PBC based on histological findings of bile duct destruction. At the same time the patient was diagnosed with PBC she showed negative results for anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies, despite complaining of thirst and eye dryness. She was examined at the Department of Otolaryngology at our hospital and was diagnosed with SjS secondary to PBC based on a positive Schirmer’s test result and labial gland biopsy results. Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment (600 mg/day) and prednisolone (PSL) treatment (30 mg/day) were initiated. PSL was subsequently tapered and discontinued in 2007. Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment was continued on an outpatient basis. The patient underwent lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy in December 2013 for bloody stools. A mildly red elevated lesion measuring 5 mm maximum diameter was found in the rectum below the peritoneal reflection. An endoscopy performed in May 2014 showed the rectal lesion to have transformed to a pitted, red submucosal tumor (Fig. a). The lesion appeared as normal mucosa on narrow-band imaging colonoscopy. A hypoechoic lesion was seen in the second to third layers on endoscopic ultrasonography (Fig. b). As the histopathological examination revealed no evidence of malignancy and infiltration of lymphoid cells, an immunohistochemical examination was not performed. Although the histopathological examination revealed no fibromuscular obliteration, the patient was diagnosed with rectal mucosal prolapse syndrome based on endoscopic findings of similarity with lymphoma. With mild bloody stools persisting, the patient was admitted to our department in July 2014 for further evaluation and treatment.\nTests on admission revealed thrombocytopenia and anemia. Liver function was classified as Child-Pugh class B based on blood biochemistry tests. Positive serum antinuclear antibody findings (1:640 speckled pattern) and a high AMA-M2 (41.3 index) were not inconsistent with PBC.\nSoluble interleukin-2 receptor was slightly elevated, but all other tumor markers were within the normal ranges. Negative results were obtained for both anti-H. pylori antibody and H. pylori antigen stool test.\nColonoscopy performed in July 2014 showed the rectal lesion as a hard, reddish, elevated lesion measuring 30 mm maximum diameter (Fig. ). Histopathological examination of the elevated lesion and surrounding mucosa with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed dense infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphocytes into the mucosa, with some lymphocytic infiltration in the crypt epithelium (Fig. a). Tissues were diffusely positive for CD20 staining and negative for CD3 staining (Fig. b, c). κ light-chain staining was more pronounced than λ staining at the site. As Ki-67 (MIB-1) labeling index was 30 % and immunohistochemistry for CD5, cyclinD1, and CD10 showed negative staining, we diagnosed MALT lymphoma (Fig. d).\nIn contrast to abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed in December 2013, which showed only hepatic cirrhosis and splenomegaly, abdominal CT performed when the patient was admitted showed ascites, thickening of the rectal wall and evidence of surrounding inflammation, and enlargement of the lateral and para-aortic lymph nodes. Positron emission tomography/CT revealed circumferential fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the rectum below the peritoneal reflection (Rb) and FDG accumulation in the lateral and para-aortic lymph nodes (Fig. ). The lesion was classified using Lugano classification as stage II2 malignant lymphoma based on these findings. Duodenoscopy and CT revealed no other MALT lymphoma within the gastrointestinal tract. The patient refused aggressive examinations, such as enteroscopy and surgery because the hepatic cirrhosis was uncompensated, the prognosis for MALT lymphoma is relatively good, and surgery would have required colostomy. Although H. pylori eradication has proven effective in some patients showing negative results for the pathogen [, ], it was not performed for this patient because she had PBC and SjS, which indicated autoimmune involvement. Although upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed slight mucosal atrophy in the antrum of the stomach, there was no H. pylori infection as well as no history of H. pylori eradication. Radiation therapy was effective for primary rectal MALT lymphoma with no distant spread [–]. In this case, four courses of once-weekly rituximab, which has a favorable safety profile, were prescribed at 375 mg/m2 with the consent of the patient and her family to treat persistent bleeding. A proctoscopy performed 3 months after treatment showed the elevated lesion to have flattened almost entirely (Fig. ). A biopsy showed only mild lymphocytic infiltration. CT revealed reduction of rectal wall thickening and surrounding inflammation with no lymph node enlargement, as seen before rituximab treatment. The efficacy of rituximab monotherapy was partial remission of MALT lymphoma in this case. Further rituximab monotherapy was not performed for this patient because she had no bloody stools and did not wish further treatment.",

        "title": "Adult type granulosa cell tumor of the testis with a heterologous sarcomatous component: case report and review of the literature",
        "patient": "A 78-year old Caucasian male was admitted to hospital due to acute neurological symptoms. Upon exploration, he reported a history of hypertension and arrhythmia. Upon physical examination, an enlarged left testicle was noted and an inguinal herniotomy scar on the left side. According to statements by the patient, the testicle had started to enlarge a year earlier. After neurological symptoms had remitted, the patient was transferred to the urological unit for further diagnostic procedures. A painless and solid scrotal mass could be palpated on the left side. The left epididymis was not discernible at palpation. The right testicle and epididymis were unremarkable. Upon ultrasonography, the mass had a diameter of 13 cm and contained cystic spaces surrounded by solid tumor structures (Figure \n). There were no enlarged inguinal or abdominal lymph nodes. Upon computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, a cyst measuring 2.5 cm was found in the right kidney, but masses raising suspicion of metastases were not detected. As a consequence of the clinical findings, inguinal semicastration of the left testis was performed. Twenty three months following surgery, the patient is alive and without signs of progressive disease.\nMacroscopically the tumor was composed of solid white or brownish firm masses with multiple cystic spaces.Microscopically the tumor consisted of rather monomorphous typical granulosa cells with scanty cytoplasm and angulated, coffee-bean like, grooved nuclei (Figure \n). The cells grew mainly in solid patterns with some trabecular and gyriform areas and a few cysts lined by tumor cells containing an eosinophilic fluid (Figure \n). Some not well-differentiated microfollicular structures resembling Call-Exner bodies could be found interspersed (Figure \n). Mitotic figures were extremely rare. The tumor showed central necrotic areas. The main part of the tumor was surrounded by fibrotic tissue in which small nests of undifferentiated, spindled cells ordered in sheets were located. These cells did not exhibit any polymorphism and mitotic figures were lacking. At the border of a hyalinized area a proliferation of large, polygonal and spindled cells with many tumor giant cells were present (Figures \n and\n). The cells had a clear or slightly eosinophylic cytoplasm and markedly polymorphic nuclei with large nucleoli. Almost all mitotic figures (1/hpf) were atypical. Accordingly, the proliferation rate of these sarcomatous cells, assessed by MIB-1 antibodies, was consistently higher (focally > 50%) than that of the typical granulosa cells (<1%). Very large, spindled sarcomatous cells were also found scattered among fibrous collagen rich tissue. The sarcomatous area was infiltrated by a startling number of eosinophilic leucocytes.\nImmunohistochemically, single typical granulosa cells showed a week reactivity for inhibin and a strong but patchy distributed reactivity for calretinin. Vimentin and CD 99 (Figure \n) as well as progesterone receptor (PR) were strongly expressed in the typical granulosa cells (>70%) as well in the sarcomatous one, whereas androgen- (AR) and estrogen-(ER) receptor antibodies did not show any reactivity. Interestingly, the sarcomatous tumor cells reacted strongly with pancytokeratin antibodies (AE1:AE3) (Figure \n); by way of contrast, the typical granulosa cells were completely unreactive.\nSince the FOXL2 402C → G (C134W) mutation is also present in adult-type granulosa cell tumors occurring in men, although in a smaller proportion when compared with the rates reported in women\n[], we also performed this mutation analysis. To this end, DNA of the tumor cells was extracted from serial sections (FFPE tissue) after manual microdissection using the Maxwell 16 System (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.\nMutation hotspot region containing codon 134 was amplified by PCR (primer sense: 5′- CAACTACTGGACGCTGGACC-3′; primer antisense: 5′-GTTGCCCTTCTCGAACATGTCT-3′). Sequencing analysis was performed using the PyroMark Q24 system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions (sequencing primer: 5′- CGCTGGACCCGGCCT-3′). Detailed information about PCR and sequencing conditions is available on request. A FOXL2p.C134W mutation was nonetheless not detectable.",

Upon exploration, he reported a history of hypertension and arrhythmia. Upon physical examination, an enlarged left testicle was noted and an inguinal herniotomy scar on the left side. According to statements by the patient, the testicle had started to enlarge a year earlier. After neurological symptoms had remitted, the patient was transferred to the urological unit for further diagnostic procedures. A painless and solid scrotal mass could be palpated on the left side. The left epididymis was not discernible at palpation. The right testicle and epididymis were unremarkable. Upon ultrasonography, the mass had a diameter of 13 cm and contained cystic spaces surrounded by solid tumor structures (Figure \n). There were no enlarged inguinal or abdominal lymph nodes. Upon computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, a cyst measuring 2.5 cm was found in the right kidney, but masses raising suspicion of metastases were not detected. As a consequence of the clinical findings, inguinal semicastration of the left testis was performed. Twenty three months following surgery, the patient is alive and without signs of progressive disease.\nMacroscopically the tumor was composed of solid white or brownish firm masses with multiple cystic spaces.Microscopically the tumor consisted of rather monomorphous typical granulosa cells with scanty cytoplasm and angulated, coffee-bean like, grooved nuclei (Figure \n). The cells grew mainly in solid patterns with some trabecular and gyriform areas and a few cysts lined by tumor cells containing an eosinophilic fluid (Figure \n). Some not well-differentiated microfollicular structures resembling Call-Exner bodies could be found interspersed (Figure \n). Mitotic figures were extremely rare. The tumor showed central necrotic areas. The main part of the tumor was surrounded by fibrotic tissue in which small nests of undifferentiated, spindled cells ordered in sheets were located. These cells did not exhibit any polymorphism and mitotic figures were lacking. At the border of a hyalinized area a proliferation of large, polygonal and spindled cells with many tumor giant cells were present (Figures \n and\n). The cells had a clear or slightly eosinophylic cytoplasm and markedly polymorphic nuclei with large nucleoli. Almost all mitotic figures (1/hpf) were atypical. Accordingly, the proliferation rate of these sarcomatous cells, assessed by MIB-1 antibodies, was consistently higher (focally > 50%) than that of the typical granulosa cells (<1%). Very large, spindled sarcomatous cells were also found scattered among fibrous collagen rich tissue. The sarcomatous area was infiltrated by a startling number of eosinophilic leucocytes.\nImmunohistochemically, single typical granulosa cells showed a week reactivity for inhibin and a strong but patchy distributed reactivity for calretinin. Vimentin and CD 99 (Figure \n) as well as progesterone receptor (PR) were strongly expressed in the typical granulosa cells (>70%) as well in the sarcomatous one, whereas androgen- (AR) and estrogen-(ER) receptor antibodies did not show any reactivity. Interestingly, the sarcomatous tumor cells reacted strongly with pancytokeratin antibodies (AE1:AE3) (Figure \n); by way of contrast, the typical granulosa cells were completely unreactive.\nSince the FOXL2 402C → G (C134W) mutation is also present in adult-type granulosa cell tumors occurring in men, although in a smaller proportion when compared with the rates reported in women\n[], we also performed this mutation analysis. To this end, DNA of the tumor cells was extracted from serial sections (FFPE tissue) after manual microdissection using the Maxwell 16 System (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.\nMutation hotspot region containing codon 134 was amplified by PCR (primer sense: 5′- CAACTACTGGACGCTGGACC-3′; primer antisense: 5′-GTTGCCCTTCTCGAACATGTCT-3′). Sequencing analysis was performed using the PyroMark Q24 system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions (sequencing primer: 5′- CGCTGGACCCGGCCT-3′). Detailed information about PCR and sequencing conditions is available on request. A FOXL2p.C134W mutation was nonetheless not detectable.''' \n\n output:"

Despite her medical history,\nshe was strong and able to withstand intensive physical labor including farm work.\nShe had not received antimicrobial agents or been hospitalized in the previous 90\ndays, and had no history of overseas travel. None of her family members had any sign\nof infection.\nUpon admission, her general condition was serious and vital signs indicated sepsis;\nher body temperature was 39.5°C, heart rate 122 beats per minute, blood pressure\n117/64 mmHg with the continuous use of norepinephrine 0.3 µg/kg/minute, respiratory\nrate 25 breaths/minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation 95% after nasal catheter\noxygen inhalation with an oxygen flow rate of 8 L/minute. Meningeal irritation signs\nand the Babinski sign were negative. Breath sounds in both lungs were thick with a\nsmall amount of dry rales, and decreased breath sounds were detected in the right\nlower lung field. Liver percussion caused pain, although her abdomen was soft with\nno tenderness and her liver and spleen were not palpable.\nPeripheral blood analysis yielded the following results: white blood cell count,\n8.65 × 109/L (neutrophils 94.7%); hemoglobin level, 106.1 g/L; and\nplatelet count, 32 × 109/L. C-reactive protein levels were 400.7 mg/L and\nprocalcitonin (PCT) levels were 92.28 ng/mL.

The arterial blood gas analysis showed type 1 respiratory failure (pH 7.43, PO2 7.34 kPa, and PCO2 5.09 kPa). There was lymphopenia (0.56 × 109/L) without neutrophilia and the CRP was 112 units/L. The RT-PCR test was positive and the CXR showed bilateral lower zone opacities (Figure ). She was treated with oxygen, doxycycline, and prophylactic enoxaparin and was discharged in 4 d. One week later she presented with syncope, severe breathlessness, chest tightness, tachycardia, hypoxia, and hypotension. Troponin I was raised at 205 ng/L (5-14 ng/L), along with a raised D-dimer of 6.26 μg/mL. The repeat CXR showed improving bibasilar infiltrates (Figure ). The CTPA showed bilateral extensive thromboembolism in the pulmonary arterial branches (Figure ), along with evidence of resolving COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure ; lung window).

The arterial blood gas analysis showed type 1 respiratory failure (pH 7.43, PO2 7.34 kPa, and PCO2 5.09 kPa). There was lymphopenia (0.56 × 109/L) without neutrophilia and the CRP was 112 units/L. The RT-PCR test was positive and the CXR showed bilateral lower zone opacities (Figure ). She was treated with oxygen, doxycycline, and prophylactic enoxaparin and was discharged in 4 d. One week later she presented with syncope, severe breathlessness, chest tightness, tachycardia, hypoxia, and hypotension. Troponin I was raised at 205 ng/L (5-14 ng/L), along with a raised D-dimer of 6.26 μg/mL. The repeat CXR showed improving bibasilar infiltrates (Figure ). The CTPA showed bilateral extensive thromboembolism in the pulmonary arterial branches (Figure ), along with evidence of resolving COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure ; lung window). She underwent thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, followed by therapeutic enoxaparin for an initial 4 d. She was discharged on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 d, followed by 20 mg once daily for 3 more mo.\nThese cases illustrate some of the discrepancies between the clinical and imaging features of COVID-19.

        "title": "Change of Pathological Type to Metaplastic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Breast During Disease Recurrence: Case Report and Literature Review",
        "patient": "In 2015, a 55-year-old woman with a palpable lump in the inner quadrant of the right breast presented to the Breast Center in our hospital. She had no other clinical symptoms such as pain, skin change, nipple retraction, or nipple discharge. She was a non-smoker and denied having any systemic diseases or any family history of breast or ovary cancer, but her father died of gastric adenocarcinoma, and her mother died of lung cancer. On physical examination, there was a 2 × 1 cm mass at 3 o'clock in the right breast, 2 cm away from the nipple. The lump was firm, border unclear, moveable, irregular, and not fixed to the skin or chest wall. No abnormality was found in the axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes. A mammogram showed a lesion classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4B in the inner quadrant of the right breast (). The ultrasound showed an irregular hypoechoic mass of 1.2 × 0.8 cm located at 3–4 o'clock, and no positive lymph node was detected ().\nWe performed an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). After detailed discussion with the surgeon, the patient chose to preserve her breast. So we performed a right breast mass resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy on December 14, 2015. An invasive carcinoma in the mammary gland was localized in the lower inner quadrant with a maximum diameter of 0.6 cm. Histologically, the tumor was predominantly grade 2 IDC (about 60%), partial invasive micropapillary carcinoma (about 20%), and partial ductal carcinoma in situ (about 20%) with focal dysplasia in the upper resection margin (). There was no metastasis in the sentinel lymph nodes (0/6). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor was ER-negative, PR-negative, CerbB-2–positive (intensity 1), CK5/6-negative, P53-positive 70%, EGFR-focal positive, and Ki-67–positive 80%, and a FISH test demonstrated negative Her-2 gene amplification (). Thus, the tumor was pT1N0M0, equivalent to stage Ia.\nAfter surgery, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel every 3 weeks. She then underwent adjuvant radiation with simultaneous integrated boost intensity modulated radiotherapy (SIB-IMRT) to the whole right breast to a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and to the high-risk area for recurrence to a total dose of 60.2 Gy in 28 fractions (). Since the surgery, there had been no evidence of recurrence or metastasis for 24 months' follow-up.\nThen the patient felt a nodule in the right breast again, and the size of this nodule gradually increased. Four months later, she received an ultrasound examination, which found that there was an irregular non-homogeneous-echo mass in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast below the surgical incision and had biopsy-proven disease recurrence in the right breast which revealed SCC. A mammogram showed an abnormal density shadow in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast, which lead to suspicion of malignant lesions, and enlarged left axillary lymph nodes (), which biopsy indicated to be invasive carcinoma. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) conference board recommended bilateral breast modified radical mastectomy on March 15, 2018. An invasive carcinoma in the right mammary gland was localized in the lower inner quadrant, measuring 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.3 cm, and 1 of the 15 left axillary lymph nodes removed was malignant. No abnormality was found in the left breast or right axillary lymph nodes. Microscopic examination of the tumors revealed metaplastic SCC with an ER-negative, PR-negative, Her-2–negative, CK5/6-positive, P53-positive 50%, EGFR-positive, and Ki-67–positive 70% phenotype detected by immunohistochemical staining (; ).\nFollowing surgery, the case was then discussed in an MDT conference because of the change of pathological type. Adjuvant chemotherapy with six cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin was planned (TP chemotherapy). But after three cycles, the TP chemotherapy was stopped because of severe drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events. The patient then accepted docetaxel and capecitabine for another three cycles. From October 10, 2018, to November 15, 2018, she underwent adjuvant radiotherapy with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the left supraclavicular and apical axillary regions with a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions (). There has been no recurrent or metastatic evidence in the 16 months' follow-up since the second surgery.",

        "title": "Hit the mark with diffusion-weighted imaging: metastases of rhabdomyosarcoma to the extraocular eye muscles",
        "patient": "In April 2010, an otherwise healthy 15-year-old girl first presented with acute left-sided protrusio bulbi. MRI revealed an extraconal mass in the left superonasal orbital quadrant with infiltration of the paranasal sinuses and the skull base (Figure a). Endonasal biopsy confirmed alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with PAX3-FKHR-translocation. PET/CT did not show evidence of metastatic spread, and the tumour was staged as T2 N0 M0. Chemotherapy, radiation treatment of the primary tumour and complete tumour resection followed. Five months after completion of treatment, follow-up imaging with PET/CT and MRI detected a solitary bone metastasis in the right femoral neck and two intramammary soft tissue metastases. Tumorous bone marrow infiltration of less than 1% was diagnosed in bone marrow specimen. Multimodal treatment, including chemotherapy, surgical resection of the metastases, local radiation and haploid stem cell therapy achieved complete response.\nIn early 2012, three months post-therapy, the patient complained about newly occurred double vision. In comparison to numerous preceding MRI studies, a new, though initially very discrete, thickening of the left medial rectus and inferior rectus muscle was observed in the absence of other intraorbital signal alterations (Figure b, c). As clinical symptoms aggravated over the ensuing three weeks, we noted progressive bulging of all extraocular left extraocular eye muscles and thickening of the right medial rectus muscle. MRI signal alterations included homogenous T2w signal elevation, increased uptake of contrast media and increasingly restricted diffusivity on follow-up MRI examinations (1.5 Tesla Magnetom Symphony and 3 Tesla Trio, Siemens Medical, Germany, diffusion-weighted single-shot echoplanar SS-EPI imaging with b-values of 0 and 1000 s/mm2; at 1.5 Tesla TR 4600 ms, TE 137 ms, no parallel imaging, at 3 Tesla TR 3300 ms, TE 90 ms, parallel imaging iPAT = 2). Restricted diffusion was indicated by progressively high intralesional signal on DWI at b = 1000 s/mm2 and a corresponding drop in ADC values (apparent diffusion coefficient, unit 10−3 mm2/s) from 1.25 (long-standing baseline) to 0.6 × 10−3 mm2/s in the left medial rectus muscle within three weeks. A similar time course of ADC in correlation to progressive muscular thickening was observed in all affected eye muscles (Figure d, Figure day 20 to day 36). Whole-body FDG-PET/CT visualised intralesional tracer uptake exceeding physiological muscular signal in the absence of suspicious extraorbital lesions. Open biopsy of the left inferior rectus muscle was performed seven weeks after onset of double vision. Histological evaluation initially showed fibrosis and interstitial oedema without signs of tumour infiltration. Further serial sectioning and additional immunohistochemical staining revealed a small number of scattered atypical cells suggestive of rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient suffered further clinical deterioration with massive exophthalmos and impaired vision of the left eye, accompanied by further progression on MRI with persistently low ADC values (Figure , Figure day 59). Eleven weeks after the onset of orbital symptoms, operative transnasal decompression of the left orbita became necessary in order to prevent loss of vision. Intraoperative biopsy showed extensive tumour infiltration of striated muscle and surrounding fatty tissue by small round blue cells with alveolar growth pattern, expression of myogenin, focal positivity for desmin and weak expression of MyoD1 (Figure ). Oral chemotherapy and radiation of both orbital cavities resulted in complete tumour remission and elevated muscular ADC above baseline level up to oedema-equivalent values (1.4 ~ 1.6 × 10−3 mm2/s) (Figure day 105). However, after another fifteen months and two more local recurrences treated with palliative chemoradiotherapy, the patient eventually suffered diffuse systemic metastatic spread and deceased in August 2013. The first intramuscular tumour relapse after three months of complete remission (Figure , day 237), the subsequent episodes of local recurrence and the eventual systemic spread (ADC values not shown in Figure ) were again all characterised by high DWI signal and very low intralesional ADC ranging between 0.5 and 0.9 × 10−3 mm2/s.",

MRI revealed an extraconal mass in the left superonasal orbital quadrant with infiltration of the paranasal sinuses and the skull base (Figure a). Endonasal biopsy confirmed alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with PAX3-FKHR-translocation. PET/CT did not show evidence of metastatic spread, and the tumour was staged as T2 N0 M0. Chemotherapy, radiation treatment of the primary tumour and complete tumour resection followed. Five months after completion of treatment, follow-up imaging with PET/CT and MRI detected a solitary bone metastasis in the right femoral neck and two intramammary soft tissue metastases. Tumorous bone marrow infiltration of less than 1% was diagnosed in bone marrow specimen. Multimodal treatment, including chemotherapy, surgical resection of the metastases, local radiation and haploid stem cell therapy achieved complete response.\nIn early 2012, three months post-therapy, the patient complained about newly occurred double vision. In comparison to numerous preceding MRI studies, a new, though initially very discrete, thickening of the left medial rectus and inferior rectus muscle was observed in the absence of other intraorbital signal alterations (Figure b, c). As clinical symptoms aggravated over the ensuing three weeks, we noted progressive bulging of all extraocular left extraocular eye muscles and thickening of the right medial rectus muscle. MRI signal alterations included homogenous T2w signal elevation, increased uptake of contrast media and increasingly restricted diffusivity on follow-up MRI examinations (1.5 Tesla Magnetom Symphony and 3 Tesla Trio, Siemens Medical, Germany, diffusion-weighted single-shot echoplanar SS-EPI imaging with b-values of 0 and 1000 s/mm2; at 1.5 Tesla TR 4600 ms, TE 137 ms, no parallel imaging, at 3 Tesla TR 3300 ms, TE 90 ms, parallel imaging iPAT = 2). Restricted diffusion was indicated by progressively high intralesional signal on DWI at b = 1000 s/mm2 and a corresponding drop in ADC values (apparent diffusion coefficient, unit 10−3 mm2/s) from 1.25 (long-standing baseline) to 0.6 × 10−3 mm2/s in the left medial rectus muscle within three weeks. A similar time course of ADC in correlation to progressive muscular thickening was observed in all affected eye muscles (Figure d, Figure day 20 to day 36). Whole-body FDG-PET/CT visualised intralesional tracer uptake exceeding physiological muscular signal in the absence of suspicious extraorbital lesions. Open biopsy of the left inferior rectus muscle was performed seven weeks after onset of double vision. Histological evaluation initially showed fibrosis and interstitial oedema without signs of tumour infiltration. Further serial sectioning and additional immunohistochemical staining revealed a small number of scattered atypical cells suggestive of rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient suffered further clinical deterioration with massive exophthalmos and impaired vision of the left eye, accompanied by further progression on MRI with persistently low ADC values (Figure , Figure day 59). Eleven weeks after the onset of orbital symptoms, operative transnasal decompression of the left orbita became necessary in order to prevent loss of vision. Intraoperative biopsy showed extensive tumour infiltration of striated muscle and surrounding fatty tissue by small round blue cells with alveolar growth pattern, expression of myogenin, focal positivity for desmin and weak expression of MyoD1 (Figure ). Oral chemotherapy and radiation of both orbital cavities resulted in complete tumour remission and elevated muscular ADC above baseline level up to oedema-equivalent values (1.4 ~ 1.6 × 10−3 mm2/s) (Figure day 105). However, after another fifteen months and two more local recurrences treated with palliative chemoradiotherapy, the patient eventually suffered diffuse systemic metastatic spread and deceased in August 2013. The first intramuscular tumour relapse after three months of complete remission (Figure , day 237), the subsequent episodes of local recurrence and the eventual systemic spread (ADC values not shown in Figure ) were again all characterised by high DWI signal and very low intralesional ADC ranging between 0.5 and 0.9 × 10−3 mm2/s.''' \n\n output:"

He had initially been treated in the prison hospital, where antibiotics were given and oral feeding encouraged. After 15 days he was brought to our centre. On arrival, he complained of chest pain, cough with purulent foul smelling sputum, dysphagia, and odynophagia since the incident which was 15 days ago. There was an associated swinging fever, malaise and anorexia. On examination, he was wasted very ill looking and drooling foul smelling saliva from the oral cavity, pale and febrile at 38.5 degrees centigrade. Trachea was central. Respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, but right side was not moving with respiration. The left side had a normal examination; the right side had features of an effusion with no air entry. He had normal cardiovascular exam, save for a tachycardia of 112 bpm in sinus rhythm. The abdominal exam was also normal. The chest radiographs showed a right hydropneumothorax, no pneumomediastinum was noted, the left hemi thorax was normal. The barium oesophagram could not be done because the machine had broken down. A diagnosis of perforated oesophagus with a foreign body in situ was made. A tube thoracostomy was inserted and drained purulent material that was foul smelling. Nil by mouth with Intravenous fluids was prescribed. Broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics were prescribed for a period of 1 week. Blood for a complete blood picture was taken and showed low haemoglobin 9 g/l, leucocytosis with neutrophilia, other parameters were normal. The repeat chest radiograph did not show the piece of wood in the oesophagus, but showed a decrease in the right chest hydrothorax and some lung expansion. The patient was scheduled for oesophagoscopy in two days when the fever had subsided. This would also attempt to remove the foreign body. The oesophagoscopy revealed that the proximal part of the foreign body was at 15 cm from the incisors. The surrounding oesophagus was necrotic and friable. Removal failed because the foreign body was firmly attached and there was fear of tearing through vital mediastinal structures if excess force was used. A laparotomy was done for feeding gastrostomy tube insertion, but at opening the stomach, the distal end of the piece of wood was seen. It was gently pulled down and safely removed. It was 18 cm long and the widest part was 3 cm with the narrowest 0.5 cm end in the stomach. A feeding gastrostomy was there fore created.\nOn the ward he was advised to feed by gastrostomy and not orally, so as to reduce contamination and rest the oesophagus. Post laparotomy he continued to feed orally and by gastrostomy against the recommendations. This happened for 2 days and the patient started to deteriorate, having a high grade fever, productive cough and dyspnoea and died of sepsis three days later.",

        "patient": "An 85-year-old man with a 60-pack-year history of smoking presented with epigastric discomfort, loss of appetite, and weight loss of 2 kilograms over the past month. The patient quit smoking in his 50s and had a pacemaker implanted for complete atrioventricular block 7 years earlier. He had been medicated for hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, chronic heart failure, and benign prostatic hypertrophy for more than 5 years, and these diseases were well controlled. During the first visit, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed chronic atrophic gastritis with a small ectopic pancreas. A proton pump inhibitor, mosapride, and digestive enzymes were administered to him for a week. However, his symptoms were not alleviated, and he complained of additional multiple pains appearing in the head, neck, and left shoulder. Pregabalin was additionally administered, but his symptoms gradually worsened. As a result, the patient was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nOn physical examination, thickness and rigidity of his left neck and shoulder were detected. No lymph nodes were palpable. Wheezes were audible at the end of expiration. Oxyhemoglobin saturation was 98% without oxygen therapy. Laboratory tests revealed hypoproteinemia (total protein 6.5 g/dL), renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 1.44 mg/dL), and mild inflammation (C-reactive protein 0.86 mg/dL). The other common biochemical tests and blood cell counts were within the normal range. Urinalysis revealed no remarkable abnormal findings, and the fecal occult blood test was negative. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an obscure soft tissue in the left supraclavicular fossa, a swollen left levator scapulae muscle, and enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck ( and ). CT also detected pulmonary consolidation, with an interlobular pleural shift in the left upper lobe and misty mesentery ( and ). Although no tumor mass was detected in the neck, sarcoma or another malignancy was suspected. In addition, coexisting infectious diseases, such as cellulitis of the neck and/or bacterial pneumonia, were also considered.\nHis general status worsened by the day. A biopsy from the affected lesions of the neck was considered but could not be performed owing to his deteriorating state, which featured high fever, unconsciousness, and circulatory insufficiency. The epithelial tumor marker, carcinoembryonic antigen, was elevated (264.3 ng/mL) on the sixth day of hospitalization. Thereafter, he required steroids and antibiotics, as well as opioids, to relieve his symptoms. He died only 16 days after admission to the hospital.\nWith the consent of his proxy, an autopsy was performed. Grossly, multiple tumors and tumor-like lesions with lymphadenopathies were found in the left upper lobe of the lung, the mesentery of the small bowel, and the left neck (). These findings were compatible with the results of the enhanced CT scan (). Microscopically, the lung tumors were composed of poorly differentiated polymorphic cells mixed with spindle cells (). Thickened soft tissue in the left neck was invaded by atypical malignant cells similar to those in the lung (). The invasion had spread to the subclavian vessels, the common carotid artery/vein, and the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The mesentery had also been invaded by malignant cells similar to those in the lung and neck (). Although these three malignant tumors were detected, the origin was unclear by the findings of hematoxylin–eosin stain alone. Immunohistochemically, these cells in multiple organs were all positive for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, TTF-1, Napsin-A, and Vimentin (–), but negative for P40/CK14, PAX8, Thyroglobulin, Desmin, MyoD1, and S100 (data not shown). Based on these findings, the tumors had their primary origin in the lung; therefore, they were diagnosed as PPC with an adenocarcinoma component with metastasis. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, clone 22C3) was detected with a low level of tumor proportion score (TPS) in the lung tumor cells (). The autopsy revealed no evidence of infection and concluded that the cause of death was circulatory insufficiency induced by cachexia due to advanced PPC.\nOur review of the literature revealed 33 case reports of PPC having distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis (). The common sites of metastases were the adrenal glands (11 cases), bones (9 cases), gastrointestinal tract (7 cases), and brain (5 cases); there was only one case (other than ours) with metastasis to the soft tissue, including the muscle (Case 1, ). Typical CT findings consistently showed one or more distinct lung masses, versus our unusual CT findings (no mass lesion but focal consolidation). Immunohistochemically, it is interesting to note that some cases had positive results for Vimentin and extremely short survival (Cases 5, 9, 18, 23, and 33, ), and they are similar to our case. However, there are no clear correlations of immunohistochemical markers across all case reports. Various treatments were employed, usually in combination, and the range in survival was very broad, from days and weeks to beyond 7 years. No clear correlations between treatment and survival can be drawn in this small collection of cases; however, most patients treated with ICIs were alive at the time of each publication. Most ICIs were adopted as adjuvants to conventional chemotherapy.",

Computed tomography (CT) revealed an obscure soft tissue in the left supraclavicular fossa, a swollen left levator scapulae muscle, and enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck ( and ). CT also detected pulmonary consolidation, with an interlobular pleural shift in the left upper lobe and misty mesentery ( and ). Although no tumor mass was detected in the neck, sarcoma or another malignancy was suspected. In addition, coexisting infectious diseases, such as cellulitis of the neck and/or bacterial pneumonia, were also considered.\nHis general status worsened by the day. A biopsy from the affected lesions of the neck was considered but could not be performed owing to his deteriorating state, which featured high fever, unconsciousness, and circulatory insufficiency. The epithelial tumor marker, carcinoembryonic antigen, was elevated (264.3 ng/mL) on the sixth day of hospitalization. Thereafter, he required steroids and antibiotics, as well as opioids, to relieve his symptoms. He died only 16 days after admission to the hospital.\nWith the consent of his proxy, an autopsy was performed. Grossly, multiple tumors and tumor-like lesions with lymphadenopathies were found in the left upper lobe of the lung, the mesentery of the small bowel, and the left neck (). These findings were compatible with the results of the enhanced CT scan (). Microscopically, the lung tumors were composed of poorly differentiated polymorphic cells mixed with spindle cells (). Thickened soft tissue in the left neck was invaded by atypical malignant cells similar to those in the lung (). The invasion had spread to the subclavian vessels, the common carotid artery/vein, and the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The mesentery had also been invaded by malignant cells similar to those in the lung and neck (). Although these three malignant tumors were detected, the origin was unclear by the findings of hematoxylin–eosin stain alone. Immunohistochemically, these cells in multiple organs were all positive for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, TTF-1, Napsin-A, and Vimentin (–), but negative for P40/CK14, PAX8, Thyroglobulin, Desmin, MyoD1, and S100 (data not shown). Based on these findings, the tumors had their primary origin in the lung; therefore, they were diagnosed as PPC with an adenocarcinoma component with metastasis. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, clone 22C3) was detected with a low level of tumor proportion score (TPS) in the lung tumor cells (). The autopsy revealed no evidence of infection and concluded that the cause of death was circulatory insufficiency induced by cachexia due to advanced PPC.\nOur review of the literature revealed 33 case reports of PPC having distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis (). The common sites of metastases were the adrenal glands (11 cases), bones (9 cases), gastrointestinal tract (7 cases), and brain (5 cases); there was only one case (other than ours) with metastasis to the soft tissue, including the muscle (Case 1, ). Typical CT findings consistently showed one or more distinct lung masses, versus our unusual CT findings (no mass lesion but focal consolidation). Immunohistochemically, it is interesting to note that some cases had positive results for Vimentin and extremely short survival (Cases 5, 9, 18, 23, and 33, ), and they are similar to our case. However, there are no clear correlations of immunohistochemical markers across all case reports. Various treatments were employed, usually in combination, and the range in survival was very broad, from days and weeks to beyond 7 years. No clear correlations between treatment and survival can be drawn in this small collection of cases; however, most patients treated with ICIs were alive at the time of each publication. Most ICIs were adopted as adjuvants to conventional chemotherapy.''' \n\n output:"

The pathological examination showed the negative resection margins, and there was no heterogeneity. The number of nuclear fissions was 50–70 with 50 high power fields. Therefore, the pathological findings suggested that the tumor had high-risk characteristics of recurrence according to the modified Fletcher classification (Fig. a, b). Thus, he received adjuvant therapy with imatinib for 3 years and follow-up computed tomography (CT) every 6 months. No recurrence and new one occurred afterwards. In 2018, 3 years after the completion of adjuvant therapy, tumor lesions were detected at the gastric cardia with a diameter of 30 mm via follow-up CT (Fig. a). Laboratory data, including tumor markers, were almost within the normal range. Gastroscopic examination showed a submucosal tumor at the gastric cardia with a diameter of 20 mm (Fig. b). The tumor was located away from the resection margin of the previous surgery, which suggested that the tumor was not a local recurrence but a newly generated tumor. Immunohistochemistry of the biopsy from the tumor showed a positive KIT protein, and the tumor was diagnosed as a gastric GIST.

CsA was added at a daily dose of 50 mg/day (1.7 mg/kg/day). Prednisolone was tapered over 3 months and discontinued after about 1 years of regular use. CsA was prescribed continuously, with the dose of 50 mg/day since no proteinuria was noted. After a year of CsA maintenance without steroid, she developed bilateral leg edema, massive proteinuria, and decreased urine output. The dose of CsA was increased to 75 mg/day (3 mg/kg/day) for 4 months.

        "patient": "The present case is of a 70-year-old female patient with positive family history of leukaemia, colon cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the annual breast cancer screening, the mammography revealed a 1.7 cm × 2.5 cm mass in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast with axillary lymph node metastasis. Core biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) with low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), oestrogen and progesterone receptors were both positive (ER 100%, Q-score 7–8, PR 70%, Q-score 3–4), Her2 was negative (Score 0) and Ki67 labelling index was 5%. During the staging period, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan was performed and it demonstrated an abnormal FDG uptake in the upper part of the left kidney and in the right colon too (Fig. ). On colonoscopy, 7–8 polyps were detected and an endophytic tumour in the ascending colon. Biopsy of the latter mass revealed moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography confirmed a 3.8 cm × 3.6 cm mass of the left kidney and a 5 cm mass in the right colon extending until the hepatic flexure. (Fig. ) Percutaneous CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the left kidney showed renal cell carcinoma. The case was referred to the multidisciplinary oncological team.\nSince the breast tumour showed favourable biology (Grade 1, invasive ductal carcinoma with hormone receptor positivity and low Ki67 labelling index), our choice was to start her tratment with a simultaneous right hemicolectomy and left nephrectomy. During this period, aromatase inhibitor therapy had been administered for the breast cancer. Six months after the first diagnosis of the breast cancer, left sector excision and axillary block dissection were performed. After an uneventful recovery, six cycle adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, epiadrimicin, cyclophosphamid chemotherapy (FEC scheme) was administered due to lymph node involvement, followed by radiotherapy according to the international protocol. The follow-up period consists of 16 months, the patient is disease free, no tumour recurrence was noted. Postoperative histopathological evaluation of the colon specimen demonstrated a 5 cm, Grade 2, pT3N0 mucinous adenocarcinoma infiltrating the whole thickness of the bowel wall. All 18 lymph nodes were devoid of metastases. Venous invasion was present within the subserosa of the bowel wall. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in tumour cells (but not within stromal cells and lymphocytes), and weak nuclear reaction with MSH6 and MSH2 was observed within tumour cells and internal control cells (stromal cells and lymphocytes). The localisation, the mucinous nature and the histological appearance of the invasive cancer within the ascending colon all pointed toward the involvement of the serrated pathway. For clinical treatment purposes investigation of KRAS and BRAF was advised to define whether this tumour could be resistant to 5FU and anti-EGFR therapies (Fig. ). By molecular analysis, the tumour showed KRAS mutant and BRAF wild type. The renal specimen comprised a 4.8 cm diameter, ISUP grade 1, pT3a renal cell carcinoma with venous invasion (Fig. ). The breast specimen revealed a 2.2 cm × 2.0 cm, Grade 2 invasive breast carcinoma (pT2N2a) with low-grade DCIS. Among the nine axillary lymph nodes five demonstrated macrometastases (Fig. ).",

A PV shunt was also noted close to the tumour on dynamic abdominal CT. The hepatic tumour was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound-guided biopsy, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation was performed. This patient had mild encephalopathy, and the serum ammonia level was already increased to 104 μg dl−1 before the chemoembolisation. Hyperammonaemia worsened to 144 μg dl−1 and mild hepatic encephalopathy continued after treatment of the hepatocellular carcinoma. Amino acid solution (Aminoleban; Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) and lactulose did not alleviate the hyperammonaemia. Therefore, transcatheter embolisation of the PV shunt was planned.\nProcedure: The right femoral vein was punctured using ultrasound guidance, and a 6 Fr 11 cm sheath introducer was inserted. The right hepatic vein was catheterized using a 6 Fr 20 mm balloon catheter (SELECON, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Two pathways from the portal vein to the hepatic vein were seen on the preoperative dynamic CT. Since the right hepatic vein was dilated and because flow at the PV shunt was rapid, occlusion of the right hepatic vein was deemed impossible using the 20 mm balloon catheter. Therefore, only one pathway could be catheterized and balloon-occluded. After the balloon occlusion, the location of the PV shunt was confirmed using retrograde venography. One of the pathways of the PV shunt was embolized using 10 Interlock detachable coils (six 14 mm × 30 cm, two 14 mm × 20 cm and two 12 mm × 30 cm) (Striker, Tokyo, Japan) under flow control using the balloon catheter. Next, an attempt was made to catheterize the other pathway, but it was unsuccessful despite the use of several different preshaped catheters. Meanwhile, the patient was not able to remain still on the bed because of hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, embolisation of the right hepatic vein using an AVP II was planned.\nAfter the right jugular vein was punctured using ultrasound guidance, a 9 Fr 11 cm sheath was inserted. A 9 Fr multipurpose-type catheter (Bright tip, Cordis Corporation, Miami, FL) was led into the right hepatic vein, and the AVP II (22 mm) was deployed at the right hepatic vein. The procedural time was 135 min. The next morning, the serum ammonia level decreased to 34 mg dl–1, and hepatic encephalopathy had improved.

        "title": "The long-term survival in primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenocarcinoma: a case report",
        "patient": "A 29-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for further examination due to abdominal pain and a cystic mass in the right lower abdomen. A physical examination revealed no tumor in her abdomen on palpation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic and well-defined tumor of 8.5 cm in diameter behind the ascending colon. The tumor had enhanced and segmented components (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a mass behind the ascending colon of iso-intensity on T1-weighted and high intensity on T2-weighted images. Other bi-cystic masses of 8 cm in diameter at the right ovary and uterine fibroids were also observed (Fig. ). There was no evidence of invasion to adjacent tissues or distant metastasis. Based on imaging findings, the differential diagnosis of this tumor was thought to be neurogenic tumor, leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and primary retroperitoneal tumor. The serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within normal limits, while those of cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 and 125 (CA125) were elevated. She was diagnosed with unknown retroperitoneal tumor with benign right ovarian cyst and uterine fibroids.\nLaparotomy was performed, revealing a tumor capsulated with a thin wall behind the ascending colon, an ovarian cyst, and uterine fibroids. The tumor was completely removed without injury of its capsule. The ovarian cyst was enucleated, but the uterine fibroids were not removed in accordance with the preoperative informed consent.\nA histopathological examination showed that the tumor was unilocular with a large mural solid nodule. In the nodule, there were multi-cystic lesions covered with papillovillous hyperchromatic cells made of intestinal type epithelium ranging from adenoma- to invasive adenocarcinoma type. In addition, ovarian-like stroma was seen in the cyst wall, but ovarian tissue and teratomatous elements were not (Fig. ). An immuno-histopathological examination revealed positivity for CK 7 and CEA but negativity for CK 20 in the tumor cells (Fig. ), and negativity for estrogen and progesterone receptors in the ovarian-like stromal cells. Considering the histopathological features and the location, the tumor was diagnosed as PRMC without sarcomatous change.\nThe surgical margin was free from tumor cells. The right ovarian cyst was diagnosed as an endometrial cyst (chocolate cyst). After the surgery, she had no major complications and left our hospital 8 days later. During the follow-up period of 80 months, neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was found. Her other ovarian cysts, however, gradually enlarged, so she underwent surgery to remove them 4 years after the initial surgery. A histopathological examination revealed that they were benign chocolate cysts. The serum levels of CA 125 and CA 19-9, which had been elevated before the second surgery, normalized after surgery.\nRetroperitoneal mucinous cystic neoplasms, including cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, are so rare that the accurate incidence is not available. We searched the PubMed database for published English studies using the terms “primary” and “retroperitoneal” and “mucinous” and “cystadenocarcinoma” or “adenocarcinoma.” Cases of adenomas, borderline tumors, and metastasis to the retroperitoneum were excluded, but mixed-type tumors were included. Our present case is only the 62nd case (Table ) [–]. The mean age is 44.7 years (range 18–86 years), and the mean tumor size is 13.6 cm (range 3 to 26 cm). Only five cases were reported in males. To our knowledge, among the 51 cases in which the follow-up period was mentioned (range 1–130 months; median 16 months), only 7 cases had been followed for over 5 years. They are all alive without recurrence of disease. Although most PRMCs tend not to develop further disease, some with sarcoma-like or anaplastic components have a very aggressive character and can metastasize. Myriokefalitaki [] reported that the 5-year overall survival was 75.4%.\nThe etiology and biological behavior of PRMCs are still unclear; however, some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genesis of these tumors as follows: (1) heterotopic ovarian tissue [, , ], (2) monodermal variant of teratomas [, ], (3) intestinal duplication [], and (4) coelomic metaplasia [, , , ]. In our case, ovarian-like stroma was histopathologically found in the tumor, although no definitive evidence of ovarian tissue was observed, which was also supported by the results of an immunohistochemical examination of the estrogen and progesterone receptors. These findings exclude the hypothesis of heterotopic ovarian tissue. In addition, the hypotheses of teratoma and intestinal duplication can also be excluded because of the lack of structures of teratoma or well-developed intestinal mucosa and smooth muscle. The fourth hypothesis, which is most well-described in the previous literature, is that PMRCs occur from invaginations of the peritoneal epithelium during embryogenesis. Those invaginated coelomic epithelial cells form cysts that may act like epithelial ovarian tissue and undergo the process of Müllerian differentiation. Eventually, the coelomic epithelia of these cysts undergo metaplasia and develop a spectrum of histological cells in different stages. In our case, the ovarian-like stroma and intestinal type epithelium ranged from adenoma-type mucinous cells to invasive adenocarcinoma cells, which may be explained by the last theory. In addition, the pattern of immunohistochemical expression of CK 7 and CK 20 is similar to those seen in ovarian and pancreatic mucinous neoplasms.\nThere are no pathognomonic clinical or radiological findings for PRMC, making the preoperative diagnosis of this disease challenging. PRMCs usually present as a multi- or unilocular cystic mass, varying in size and localized anywhere in the retroperitoneal space. Regarding the imaging findings, the diagnostic value of computed tomography and MRI is similar, but MRI can further characterize these lesions and identify their mucinous component. Notable radiographic findings may include thickening and calcification of the cyst wall or mural nodules on imaging that may suggest malignant lesions []. Aspiration cytology and/or a biopsy may help with the diagnosis, although they carry risks of recurrence and dissemination in cystic tumors. Serological investigations provide limited diagnostic utility. Tumor markers, including CEA, CA 125, and CA 19-9, are also not very helpful for differentiating from other benign tumors, including ovarian cyst, cystic lymphangioma, and cystic methothelioma. Indeed, in our case, the elevation of serum levels of CA19-9 and CA 125 was also observed during the follow-up period. However, these levels normalized after she underwent a second surgery to resect the benign ovarian cysts. Therefore, imaging examinations such as CT or ultrasonography are the most effective tools for performing follow-up for PRMC.\nThe management of PRMC is not well established. There is currently no significant chemotherapy for PRMC. The commonly used chemotherapeutic regimes were cyclophosmide and adriamycin, cyclophosmide, adriamycin and cisplatin, cisplatin alone, carboplatin and paclitaxel, or carboplatin alone. Of the 12 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, 5 had recurrence (41.7%). Therefore, radical tumor excision is clearly mandatory. Radical resection without rupture is the standard therapy and the most important prognostic tool [], but whether lymphadenectomy or adjuvant chemotherapy provide benefit is still controversial [, , , , , , , ].",

A physical examination revealed no tumor in her abdomen on palpation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic and well-defined tumor of 8.5 cm in diameter behind the ascending colon. The tumor had enhanced and segmented components (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a mass behind the ascending colon of iso-intensity on T1-weighted and high intensity on T2-weighted images. Other bi-cystic masses of 8 cm in diameter at the right ovary and uterine fibroids were also observed (Fig. ). There was no evidence of invasion to adjacent tissues or distant metastasis. Based on imaging findings, the differential diagnosis of this tumor was thought to be neurogenic tumor, leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and primary retroperitoneal tumor. The serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within normal limits, while those of cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 and 125 (CA125) were elevated. She was diagnosed with unknown retroperitoneal tumor with benign right ovarian cyst and uterine fibroids.\nLaparotomy was performed, revealing a tumor capsulated with a thin wall behind the ascending colon, an ovarian cyst, and uterine fibroids. The tumor was completely removed without injury of its capsule. The ovarian cyst was enucleated, but the uterine fibroids were not removed in accordance with the preoperative informed consent.\nA histopathological examination showed that the tumor was unilocular with a large mural solid nodule. In the nodule, there were multi-cystic lesions covered with papillovillous hyperchromatic cells made of intestinal type epithelium ranging from adenoma- to invasive adenocarcinoma type. In addition, ovarian-like stroma was seen in the cyst wall, but ovarian tissue and teratomatous elements were not (Fig. ). An immuno-histopathological examination revealed positivity for CK 7 and CEA but negativity for CK 20 in the tumor cells (Fig. ), and negativity for estrogen and progesterone receptors in the ovarian-like stromal cells. Considering the histopathological features and the location, the tumor was diagnosed as PRMC without sarcomatous change.\nThe surgical margin was free from tumor cells. The right ovarian cyst was diagnosed as an endometrial cyst (chocolate cyst). After the surgery, she had no major complications and left our hospital 8 days later. During the follow-up period of 80 months, neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was found. Her other ovarian cysts, however, gradually enlarged, so she underwent surgery to remove them 4 years after the initial surgery. A histopathological examination revealed that they were benign chocolate cysts. The serum levels of CA 125 and CA 19-9, which had been elevated before the second surgery, normalized after surgery.\nRetroperitoneal mucinous cystic neoplasms, including cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, are so rare that the accurate incidence is not available. We searched the PubMed database for published English studies using the terms “primary” and “retroperitoneal” and “mucinous” and “cystadenocarcinoma” or “adenocarcinoma.” Cases of adenomas, borderline tumors, and metastasis to the retroperitoneum were excluded, but mixed-type tumors were included. Our present case is only the 62nd case (Table ) [–]. The mean age is 44.7 years (range 18–86 years), and the mean tumor size is 13.6 cm (range 3 to 26 cm). Only five cases were reported in males. To our knowledge, among the 51 cases in which the follow-up period was mentioned (range 1–130 months; median 16 months), only 7 cases had been followed for over 5 years. They are all alive without recurrence of disease. Although most PRMCs tend not to develop further disease, some with sarcoma-like or anaplastic components have a very aggressive character and can metastasize. Myriokefalitaki [] reported that the 5-year overall survival was 75.4%.\nThe etiology and biological behavior of PRMCs are still unclear; however, some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genesis of these tumors as follows: (1) heterotopic ovarian tissue [, , ], (2) monodermal variant of teratomas [, ], (3) intestinal duplication [], and (4) coelomic metaplasia [, , , ]. In our case, ovarian-like stroma was histopathologically found in the tumor, although no definitive evidence of ovarian tissue was observed, which was also supported by the results of an immunohistochemical examination of the estrogen and progesterone receptors. These findings exclude the hypothesis of heterotopic ovarian tissue. In addition, the hypotheses of teratoma and intestinal duplication can also be excluded because of the lack of structures of teratoma or well-developed intestinal mucosa and smooth muscle. The fourth hypothesis, which is most well-described in the previous literature, is that PMRCs occur from invaginations of the peritoneal epithelium during embryogenesis. Those invaginated coelomic epithelial cells form cysts that may act like epithelial ovarian tissue and undergo the process of Müllerian differentiation. Eventually, the coelomic epithelia of these cysts undergo metaplasia and develop a spectrum of histological cells in different stages. In our case, the ovarian-like stroma and intestinal type epithelium ranged from adenoma-type mucinous cells to invasive adenocarcinoma cells, which may be explained by the last theory. In addition, the pattern of immunohistochemical expression of CK 7 and CK 20 is similar to those seen in ovarian and pancreatic mucinous neoplasms.\nThere are no pathognomonic clinical or radiological findings for PRMC, making the preoperative diagnosis of this disease challenging. PRMCs usually present as a multi- or unilocular cystic mass, varying in size and localized anywhere in the retroperitoneal space. Regarding the imaging findings, the diagnostic value of computed tomography and MRI is similar, but MRI can further characterize these lesions and identify their mucinous component. Notable radiographic findings may include thickening and calcification of the cyst wall or mural nodules on imaging that may suggest malignant lesions []. Aspiration cytology and/or a biopsy may help with the diagnosis, although they carry risks of recurrence and dissemination in cystic tumors. Serological investigations provide limited diagnostic utility. Tumor markers, including CEA, CA 125, and CA 19-9, are also not very helpful for differentiating from other benign tumors, including ovarian cyst, cystic lymphangioma, and cystic methothelioma. Indeed, in our case, the elevation of serum levels of CA19-9 and CA 125 was also observed during the follow-up period. However, these levels normalized after she underwent a second surgery to resect the benign ovarian cysts. Therefore, imaging examinations such as CT or ultrasonography are the most effective tools for performing follow-up for PRMC.\nThe management of PRMC is not well established. There is currently no significant chemotherapy for PRMC. The commonly used chemotherapeutic regimes were cyclophosmide and adriamycin, cyclophosmide, adriamycin and cisplatin, cisplatin alone, carboplatin and paclitaxel, or carboplatin alone. Of the 12 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, 5 had recurrence (41.7%). Therefore, radical tumor excision is clearly mandatory. Radical resection without rupture is the standard therapy and the most important prognostic tool [], but whether lymphadenectomy or adjuvant chemotherapy provide benefit is still controversial [, , , , , , , ].''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 73-yr-old woman with atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency room complaining of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and agitation. The patient had suffered from atrial fibrillation for the last 2 yr. Her medications for the previous 2 yr included diltiazem 90 mg, metoprorol 25 mg, and aspirin 100 mg twice a day. In addition, she had been taking mirtazapine 30 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg daily for a 6 yr history of dysthymia.\nPhysical examination showed a blood pressure of 100/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a normal body temperature. Her body weight was 62.3 kg, and she was 158 cm in height. Initial laboratory results were unremarkable with a normal PT of 12.3 sec (INR 1.0). Routine chemical studies indicated normal values for total protein (6.6 g/dL), albumin (3.9 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (17 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (10 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (79 U/L), total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL) blood urea nitrogen (16.4 mg/dL), creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Results of hematological studies including complete blood counts were also normal. Mild cardiomegaly was found on the chest radiography. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation and left atrial enlargement (45 mm).\nThe patient underwent heparinization with an initial bolus administration of 3,600 IU heparin followed by continuous infusion for 6 days. Then the patient was started on 2 or 3 mg of warfarin daily (16.3 mg/week) to prevent thromboembolism, and was discharged after 3 days with a PT of 37.4 sec (INR 2.81). When she revisited the outpatient clinic after 3 days, her PT was found to be 50.0 sec (INR 3.68). After normalization of the patient's PT with warfarin withdrawal for 3 days, 1 or 2 mg/day (10.5 mg/week) of warfarin was prescribed. The PT after 3 days of treatment was 41.6 sec (INR 3.11). The administration of warfarin dose was changed (6.5-10.5 mg/week) continuously, which resulted in a PT of 20.9-43.1 sec (INR 1.64-3.21). She had to discontinue warfarin therapy temporarily 3 times. The difficulty in finding the optimal treatment dose during the induction period of anticoagulation continued for more than 2 month.\nThe patient continues to receive warfarin therapy at the outpatient clinic monthly and her PT remains within the recommended target therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), even though her warfarin dose has been reduced to 6.5 mg/week.\nThe patient was genotyped for CYP2C9 after informed consent. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and all 9 exons of the CYP2C9 gene were amplified by PCR (-). The PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISIM BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).

        "patient": "An 18-year-old woman, 2-0-1-1, had experienced irregular vaginal bleeding over the course of 6 months and was admitted to the hospital with confusion for 4 hours. After admission, the patient continued to be confused and experienced frequent vomiting. Her pupils were round and of equal size, with sensitivity to light. She complained of a stabbing pain in the neck, and the muscle strength of the extremities was grade V. Head computed tomography (CT) showed multiple hemorrhages in the right temporal-parietal lobe and occipital lobe, right temporal-parietal hematomas, ventricle compression, and midline shift (Fig. ). As the patient was young and the bleeding site was atypical, cerebrovascular malformation could not be excluded. After preoperative examination, evacuation of the hematoma in the temporal-parietal lobe and decompressive craniotomy was performed under general anesthesia. During the surgery, the intracranial hematoma was removed. We did not observe vascular malformation. Because intraoperative intracranial pressure was high, we removed the patient's skull. No special treatment was provided as the volume of the posterior occipital hematoma was small. Postoperatively, the patient had a clear mind and was able to speak fluently. The extremities were normal, and she could eat and communicate normally. Irregular vaginal bleeding was still seen, and no abnormality was found by gynecologic ultrasound. One week after the surgery, the patient experienced frequent vomiting and severe headache. CT showed an increased right occipital hematoma, right hemisphere swelling, and high pressure at the decompression window. Based on the patient's symptoms and CT examination, dehydration and conventional therapy were performed. Follow-up CT examinations showed that the occipital hematoma was in the absorption period, and her symptoms improved. To determine the cause of bleeding, we performed digital subtraction angiography that indicated abnormal vessels in the right occipital lobe, which later proved to be the blood vessel of the tumor, and an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm (Fig. ). Pulmonary CT showed an occupying lesion in the chest without a clear nature. Abdomen CT, pelvic ultrasound examination, including uterus, uterine appendages, vagina showed no occupying lesion, Twenty-five days after the surgery, recurrence of the intracranial hypertension was seen. Head CT showed bleeding in the right occipital lobe, with a hematoma over 30 mL. Conventional medication was unable to relieve the symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Hence, we performed craniotomy to remove the hematoma. During the surgery, a purple and red goiter with rich blood transport was resected for pathological examination. Based on the previous medical history, we considered it a choriocarcinoma. Postoperative head CT showed a fresh hematoma in the right frontal lobe. Based on the hematoma volume, we performed conventional therapy. The pathological report suggested brain and lung metastases of choriocarcinoma with total human chorionic gonadotropin (THCG) > 1000 mIU/mL. Histological examination of the hematoma was compatible with a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. The specimens showed several atypical pleomorphic trophoblastic cells on a necrotic background and some scattered trophoblasts in the hematoma and invading the vessel wall. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) the tumor cells, as well as neoplastic cells with a Ki-67 labeling index of 90%, positive immunoreactivity for placental alkaline phosphatase, cytokeratin, and inhibin, and negative immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Fig. ). However, the endometrial biopsy specimen showed no evidence of chorionic villi, trophoblasts, or decidual reaction. Twelve days after pathological diagnosis, the intracranial hypertension symptoms recurred, accompanied by decline in vision (only light sensation). Head CT showed a fresh hematoma in the left occipital lobe, with a small hematoma volume. We chose conventional therapy, and head CT after 3 days indicated an enlarged hematoma. The patient had a clear mind, and conventional therapy was administered. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed because we believed that the multiple bleeding sites were caused by brain metastasis of choriocarcinoma and no metastases were seen in other organs (Fig. ). Five days later, the patient asked to terminate the treatment and was discharged. One month later, the patient died of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient and patient's family consented to publication of the case.",

After admission, the patient continued to be confused and experienced frequent vomiting. Her pupils were round and of equal size, with sensitivity to light. She complained of a stabbing pain in the neck, and the muscle strength of the extremities was grade V. Head computed tomography (CT) showed multiple hemorrhages in the right temporal-parietal lobe and occipital lobe, right temporal-parietal hematomas, ventricle compression, and midline shift (Fig. ). As the patient was young and the bleeding site was atypical, cerebrovascular malformation could not be excluded. After preoperative examination, evacuation of the hematoma in the temporal-parietal lobe and decompressive craniotomy was performed under general anesthesia. During the surgery, the intracranial hematoma was removed. We did not observe vascular malformation. Because intraoperative intracranial pressure was high, we removed the patient's skull. No special treatment was provided as the volume of the posterior occipital hematoma was small. Postoperatively, the patient had a clear mind and was able to speak fluently. The extremities were normal, and she could eat and communicate normally. Irregular vaginal bleeding was still seen, and no abnormality was found by gynecologic ultrasound. One week after the surgery, the patient experienced frequent vomiting and severe headache. CT showed an increased right occipital hematoma, right hemisphere swelling, and high pressure at the decompression window. Based on the patient's symptoms and CT examination, dehydration and conventional therapy were performed. Follow-up CT examinations showed that the occipital hematoma was in the absorption period, and her symptoms improved.

        "title": "Pediatric Extramedullary Epidural Spinal Teratomas: A Case Report and Review of the Literature",
        "patient": "A 7-month-old, previously healthy male was referred for an initial consultation and evaluation to the neurosurgery clinic of a large children's hospital for a congenital deformity of the spine and an asymptomatic right midupper thoracic spinal prominence present since birth. All subsequent care, including imaging, biopsy, histology, and surgery, was performed at the same institution. He was delivered at term via cesarean section secondary to breech presentation. The patient had met all developmental milestones with no noticeable complaints of pain or neurological deficits.\nHis neurological exam revealed no motor or sensory deficits in the upper or lower extremities bilaterally. Cranial nerve testing, muscle tone, and deep tendon reflexes were intact. Visual inspection was significant for slight curvature of the spine with no spinal dysraphism or midline stigmata.\nImaging was subsequently performed to evaluate the spinal prominence noted on physical exam. Plain films of the thoracic spine demonstrated levoscoliosis and an additional osseous projection from the right posterior aspect of the midthoracic rib segment ().\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine revealed a multilobulated, partially cystic, calcified, heterogenous mass centered at the right (T5-T6) paravertebral space extending anteriorly into the dorsal aspect of the intrathoracic cavity (), right dorsal/posterior paraspinal soft tissues/musculature (), and spinal canal, resulting in severe displacement of the spinal cord, spinal stenosis and bilateral foraminal stenosis (). No intracranial abnormalities were noted. Differential diagnosis included teratoma and neuroblastoma. An open biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histology of the biopsy was consistent with mature teratoma. Throughout the time it took to schedule and perform the biopsy and receive the results (a period of 8 days from initial presentation), the patient's motor exam progressed to mild hypotonia in his lower extremities. This progression began prior to biopsy and was not believed to be a result of the biopsy. After a thorough discussion with the family, the decision was made to proceed with open tumor excision and resection.\nThe patient underwent open tumor excision and posterior decompression/laminectomy (T3 to T10) due to tumor magnitude. Neuromonitoring was used throughout the case; baseline motor signals were absent at the beginning of the case. During the procedure, three nerve rootlets (T5, T6, and T7) on the right were found penetrating through the tumor, and a three-level neurotomy was performed. The rest of the tumor was gently teased from the dura. Additionally, there was some retropleural extension into the right chest cavity. This was resected as well. Given the location of the tumor, biopsy results, and clinical picture, goals of surgery were to obtain as close to negative margins as possible. During the procedure, multiple specimens from various sites were sent for frozen histopathological analysis. These all came back consistent with mature teratoma, without any malignant features. As the tumor itself was teased off the dura, pleura, and other surrounding structures, true negative margin surgery would have been associated with significantly more morbidity. Considering benign histology, the decision was made to preserve as much function as possible and to proceed to closely monitor for recurrence post-operatively.\nHistologically, the tumor revealed skin with adnexal structures and keratinous debris, cystic spaces lined by ciliated and mucinous epithelium, neuroglial tissue, bone with bone marrow, cartilage, and mature fibro-adipose soft tissue. Mature fibrovascular soft tissue, granulation tissue, and a few bone foci were noted at the inked margins of excision. The final pathological diagnosis was consistent with a mature teratoma (Figures and ).\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, neuromonitoring reported a partial return of motor activity from a baseline of no activity. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) postoperatively for further management. He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day 1 and discharged on postoperative day 2. He returned for a follow-up visit at 1.5 weeks in a thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO) brace and received full-length plain radiographs (). His mother reported improved tone in the lower extremities and ability to stand with assistance.\nAt his 8-week postoperative visit, he remained in a thoracic lumbar sacral orthosis (TLSO) brace and continued to show improvement in lower extremity strength and ability to maintain posture. At his 6-month and 1-year postoperative visits, the patient was doing well and had progressed to crawling, cruising, and walking. He demonstrated 5/5 strength in both upper and lower extremities throughout all muscle groups. No recurrence of the tumor was noted on repeat plain radiographs, nor at one- or two-year follow-up MRI. At 1- and 2-year follow-up, he had 20-degrees of scoliosis, without any residual neurological deficits. The plan will be for continued bracing, likely until skeletal maturity to slow curve progression. He will continue to have annual follow-up through adolescence to monitor for progressive spinal deformity with plain radiographs, as well as yearly surveillance MRI through 5-year follow-up, and then will decrease frequency to every 2-3 years.",

        "patient": "A 70-year-old male presented with history of incomplete evacuation of bladder for 2 months. There were no symptoms of hesitancy, frequency, hematuria or pelvic pain. He was evaluated and detected to have a prostatic mass. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 10.4 ng/dl. He was diagnosed to have adenocarcinoma prostate on biopsy and was treated with injectable leuprolide, oral bicalutamide and orchiectomy.\nHe presented to our institute 2 months after orchiectomy with acute urinary retention requiring bladder catheterization. At presentation, the patient did not have any other complaints except for mild pain in the pelvis. His vitals were stable and he had ECOG performance status of 1. General and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Digital rectal examination suggested enlarged prostate with rectal mucosa infiltration. Investigations revealed normal biochemical and hematological parameters. Serum PSA at this time was 0.28 ng/dl.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pelvis showed widely infiltrating mass in the left prostate with involvement of the bladder and rectum and pelvic lymphadenopathy. Imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scan was done for metastatic work-up. PET/CT revealed a large heterogeneously enhancing mass involving the prostate gland, showing necrotic areas within along with ipsilateral enlarged hypermetabolic external iliac nodes, and a metastatic lesion in the left ischium as shown in . The mass measured 7.5 cm in the anteroposterior diameter, 4.9 cm in the transverse diameter and 9.5 cm in the vertical diameter. The mass laterally abutted the ischiorectal fossae and anteriorly extended up to the pubic symphysis with infiltration of the adjacent periprostatic and perivesical fat. Multiple FDG-avid nodules (maximum SUV 3.3) were seen in bilateral lungs. An FDG-avid mass (maximum SUV 5.5) was seen in the right ventricle with thrombus in the right ventricle. A thrombus was also seen in the main pulmonary artery and the descending branch of the left pulmonary artery.\nOur patient was initially diagnosed and treated as adenocarcinoma prostate. However, in view of early progression of disease and poor response to the therapy that consisted of two lines of hormonal therapy, the possibility of an alternative diagnosis was considered and a repeat prostatic biopsy was done.\nThe biopsy showed tumor composed of sheets of large oval cells having abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic large pleomorphic oval nuclei. Few bizarre tumor cells with occasional mitotic Figures were noted. Necrosis was seen without any definite pattern. Immunohistochemistry showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. The tissue was negative for epithelial membrane antigen, pancytokeratin, CD68, prostate-specific antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen and thyroid transcription factor-1. After reviewing the slides, a final diagnosis of epithelioid leiomyosarcoma of the prostate was rendered.",

        "patient": "A female patient in her 30s was referred to our institution with a complaint of persistent cough. Chest radiography revealed a mass in the right middle lung field (). Noncontrast CT showed a mass approximately 8 centimeters in diameter with relatively smooth margins in the right lung segment 6 (). A malignant lung tumor was suspected and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was done. FDG accumulation was seen in the lung mass (standardized uptake value max. 3.6) as well as in the mediastinum suggesting a malignant lung tumor with mediastinal lymph node metastasis (). Bronchoscopy revealed a tumorous lesion obstructing right B6 (). Biopsy of this lesion showed proliferation of spindle cells raising suspicion of sarcoma or spindle cell carcinoma.\nNext, contrast-enhanced CT was done, and it showed that the mediastinal lesion pointed out on FDG-PET/CT was actually a continuous extension of the lung mass into the right main pulmonary artery. A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of the pulmonary artery trunk ().\nLung ventilation-perfusion scan showed that the right lung was not perfused although sufficiently ventilated. On echocardiography, heart wall motion was intact and no signs of right heart failure were seen.\nCollectively, a sarcomatous lung tumor with extension into the right pulmonary artery trunk or PAS with extension into the right lung was suspected. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor under cardiopulmonary bypass through a median sternotomy. The existence and localization of the skip lesion was first confirmed by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Venous cannulas were placed in the right atrium and the femoral vein, and an arterial cannula was placed onto the femoral artery, and surgery was carried out with the heart beating. The left pulmonary artery was carefully dissected so as not to perturb the skip lesion and was clamped just proximal to the origin of left A3. Although the tumor filled the inside of the right pulmonary artery, its wall appeared to be intact from outside. Then the main pulmonary artery was incised just above the pulmonary valve and opened distally to expose the tumor. To remove all lesions, proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery together with the pulmonary artery trunk was resected. The left pulmonary artery was reconstructed with a 20 mm Gore-Tex vascular graft and the patient was separated from cardiopulmonary bypass. Following that, right pneumonectomy and total resection of the tumor were completed. Time on bypass was 2 hours and 11 minutes. Duration of operation was 9 hours and 9 minutes.\nGrossly, the tumor seemed to arise in the large vessel of the pulmonary circulation and invade into the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma, especially in the S6 region (Figures and ). The tumor was diagnosed as intimal sarcoma and its histological findings, proliferation of atypical spindle or polygonal cells with high mitotic activity, were also compatible with the diagnosis (). The lesions were completely removed macroscopically. Further resection, particularly the distal portion of the left main pulmonary artery, was not considered to be feasible. However, the surgical margin of the left pulmonary artery was microscopically positive for tumor cells (). The patient was followed up without further treatment.\nTwelve months after surgery, recurrence in the right ventricular outflow tract was detected. Irradiation and proton therapy were done. The recurrence is without progression 2 months after detection.",

Laboratory tests showed serum amylase 263 U/L, lipase 973 IU/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.42 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 10,800/μL, total bilirubin (T-Bil) 0.8 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 57 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 67 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 106 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) 233 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 426 U/L. He was diagnosed with alcoholic AP. He underwent conservative treatment. Fentanyl was introduced for pain relief because other analgesics were insufficient. By day 3, >1,200 μL of fentanyl was required daily. At that time, abdominal CT showed marked swelling of the pancreas with extensive inflammation of peripancreatic adipose tissue (Fig. ). His vital signs were BT 38.8°C, BP 133/88 mm Hg, HR 117 beats/min, and RR 42 breaths/min.

Sudden onset of jaundice, severe abdominal pain, and high-grade fever suggested the development of coexisting acute cholangitis secondary to an unknown biliary event. Acute cholangitis might have been the main cause of the sudden deterioration of his condition. Therefore, we decided to perform urgent ERCP on day 3. Endoscopy showed a swollen major duodenal papilla (Fig. ) that might occlude the bile duct and the pancreatic duct. We could not detect any biliary stones with cholangiography. Subsequently, EBS and NPD were performed (Fig. ). After drainage, the patient's condition rapidly improved, including a decrease in pain (Fig. ).

She was admitted to the orthopedic service for a right total hip replacement due to avascular necrosis of the right hip.\nThe patient was on Prednisolone more than 5mg/d chronically and was scheduled to undergo a moderate stress procedure, thus stress dose steroids in the form of Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV, then postoperatively 20mg IV every 8 hours for 3 doses, then pre-operative dose was resumed on post-operative day 2.\nFurthermore, THR is a major surgery, thus the patient required a chest x-ray, ECG and persantine thallium for pulmonary and cardiac screening. Hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate were continued to the morning of surgery, and resumed with oral intake and because SLE patients who have renal involvement and are on steroids are considered to be at higher risk for developing perioperative complications. Screening laboratory investigations should include CBC, renal profile and urinalysis. If the patient is found to be anemic, preparations for autologous blood donation including iron and erythropoietin may be appropriate, as substantial blood loss often occurs perioperatively. Even an asymptomatic urinary tract infection should be treated before proceeding with THR.\nDual VTE prophylaxis was recommended to be initiated, preferably with LMWH at least 12 hours before surgery and extended to 35 days after; intermittent pneumatic compression device was recommended to be used during the hospital stay along with perioperative antibiotics, such as IV Cefazolin.",

She was admitted to the orthopedic service for a right total hip replacement due to avascular necrosis of the right hip.\nThe patient was on Prednisolone more than 5mg/d chronically and was scheduled to undergo a moderate stress procedure, thus stress dose steroids in the form of Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV, then postoperatively 20mg IV every 8 hours for 3 doses, then pre-operative dose was resumed on post-operative day 2.\nFurthermore, THR is a major surgery, thus the patient required a chest x-ray, ECG and persantine thallium for pulmonary and cardiac screening. Hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate were continued to the morning of surgery, and resumed with oral intake and because SLE patients who have renal involvement and are on steroids are considered to be at higher risk for developing perioperative complications. Screening laboratory investigations should include CBC, renal profile and urinalysis. If the patient is found to be anemic, preparations for autologous blood donation including iron and erythropoietin may be appropriate, as substantial blood loss often occurs perioperatively. Even an asymptomatic urinary tract infection should be treated before proceeding with THR.\nDual VTE prophylaxis was recommended to be initiated, preferably with LMWH at least 12 hours before surgery and extended to 35 days after; intermittent pneumatic compression device was recommended to be used during the hospital stay along with perioperative antibiotics, such as IV Cefazolin.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "When the patient was first seen at the Center for Psychotic Disorders of our University Department of Psychiatry, he was a 27 year-old man in his first episode of schizophrenia (undifferentiated subtype). The onset of schizophrenia was estimated at 26 years of age. He had experienced school difficulties and could not attend regular courses to reach his high school degree. He started but was not able to attend the University courses for several years before schizophrenia onset.\nHe had been never treated with FGAs and was experiencing an acute psychotic relapse two months after the interruption of treatment with olanzapine (10 mg/die).\nAccording to his parents and the referring doctor, he had responded well to olanzapine, therefore, the drug was reintroduced (10 mg/die) while starting cognitive psychotherapy to increase motivation to treatment. Acute psychotic symptoms and active withdrawal improved in 1 month; however, he presented difficulty in concentrating and attention deficits. In the following 5 months, positive symptoms markedly improved (46% reduction of the pre-drug Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) positive factor score), but the patient experienced excessive weight increase (about 10 Kg with respect to pre-drug period) and poor response of cognitive dysfunctions (23% reduction of PANSS scores on the cognitive factor), as well as of social disability (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) = 51). He could not persist in either work or study activities for more than a few days. He dropped from drug treatment after 10 months. He experienced an acute psychotic relapse and gave his consent to restart an antipsychotic drug after 2 months. Due to the limited effect of olanzapine on cognitive dysfunctions, the patient was started on amisulpride (gradually titrated to 600 mg/die). Psychotic symptoms markedly improved in 6 weeks, while cognitive dysfunctions presented a modest amelioration: he continued to spend most of the morning hours in bed, experienced learning deficits and could not study. After 6 months on amisulpride, he showed a marked improvement on PANSS positive factor (with 48% reduction of the pre-drug score) and a modest improvement on the cognitive factors (25% reduction of pre-drug score). His weight did not return to baseline levels, although no further increase was observed. After 6 months of treatment, the patient was shifted to aripiprazole (10 mg/die). In 3 months of treatment with the latter drug he attained full clinical remission. PANSS positive, negative and cognitive factors showed marked improvement (pre-drug score reduction of 61%, 43% and 64%, respectively). On SOFAS the patient reached the score of 70. During the first 10 months of treatment, he returned to his baseline weight. He was able to attend several university courses, to study and learn with regularity, and in 1 year of treatment he could pass 6 exams. He was feeling \"..normal\" and willing \"...to manage life without drugs\". He decided to stop medication without doctor's consent. In the following two months, he experienced a relapse and gave his consent to restart aripiprazole. The drug was reintroduced at 10 mg/die, but it was deemed appropriate to increase the dosage at 15 mg/die after 3 weeks. Clinical remission and a marked improvement of cognitive dysfunctions were attained in 4 months. He was able to attend 3 courses regularly and to pass one exam during the first 5 months of treatment. He could make new friendships among university students and started to attend a political group. After 6 months of treatment with aripiprazole, PANSS positive, negative and cognitive factors attained the largest improvement (reduction of pre-drug scores of 60%, 59% and 57%, respectively) and the SOFAS score increased to 80. He gained about 3 Kg during the first 2 months and then stabilized his weight.",

On physical exam, the lesion was not tender or warm, did not have pulsation and the margins were vague. The patient first noticed the lesion when he was 9 years old. At the beginning, it had been an erythematous lesion in the nasal area which enlarged over time and used to bleed with patient’s manipulation (). No concomitant vascular lesion or family history of arterio-venous malformation was found.

MRI and CT-scan was performed which revealed a soft tissue mass without bone or cartilage involvement. CT-angiography showed a high-flow vascular lesion. Color Doppler reported a vascular lesion with dilated vessels. Stage 1: A size 90 tissue expander was inserted in the forehead area. Supratrochlear artery was identified by color Doppler and included in the flap region. Expansion was done for 10 weeks until the desired size was achieved ().\nStage 2: Embolization was done to reduce the size of the lesion and the risk of bleeding. However, no obvious change in the size, color or consistency of the lesion was noticed. Stage 3: After 48 hours the lesion was excised. Before excision, two rows of deep sutures were applied around the lesion to reduce the risk of bleeding. The feeding vessels of AVM were ligated and the lesion was completely excised off the bone and cartilage and the wound was left open ( and ).\nStage 4: After another 48 hours the patient was taken to the operating room again.

        "patient": "A 58-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with diffuse swelling of the penis, followed by sclerosis and ischemic changes in the glans and anterior segment of the penis, without bloody or purulent discharge. On review of systems, he denied fever, night sweat, and weight loss. Past medical and family history are not contributory. On admission, his vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, his face was thin and worn. No lymphadenopathy was palpated in the neck and supraclavicular region; visual examination of the genitals manifested a diffused enlargement of the penis with local ulcer and necrotic tissue in the glans penis.\nLaboratory findings showed the white blood cell count as 8100/mm3, hemoglobin as 12.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 276,000/mm3, and liver function, kidney function, and the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were within normal limits. The EBV IgG was positive in the serum, the EBV DNA determination was negative in the blood, and CRP was 22.9 mg/mL.\nPelvic enhanced MRI showed space-occupying lesions in the forward part of the penis, urethral orifice stenosis, and cavernosal swelling (Fig. ). No lesion in the bladder was identified upon cystoscopy. CT scans of chest and abdomen did not detect enlarged lymph nodes. The liver and spleen were of normal size and shape. Bone marrow biopsy showed lymphoma cell infiltration up to 3.2%.\nMicroscopic findings of the penile mass showed infiltration of medium-sized cells with irregular nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and many apoptotic bodies. The lymphoma cells exhibited a notable angioinfiltrative growth pattern, with homocentric arrangement around small arteries, and coagulative necrosis was also observed (Fig. ). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical cells were positive for CD3, CD56, vimentin, LCA, TIA-1, and granzyme B, but negative for cytokeratin, CD20, bcl-2, bcl-6, and ALK (Fig. ). In the case of in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER), most atypical cells were also labeled (Fig. ). These findings were consistent with NK/T-cell lymphoma.\nBy detailed history, we learned that the patient had nasal obstruction for more than 10 years. PET-CT found a high-FDG metabolic mass in the nasal cavity and the nasopharyngeal cavity. Space-occupying lesion in the nasal cavity was observed and biopsied with sinoscopy. Histological examination showed diffuse infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with angio-destructive growth pattern, and apoptotic bodies were present (Fig. ). The tumor cells were positive for CD3, CD56, EBER; they were negative for CD20 and granzyme B (Fig. . b-d). Based on the endoscopic and immunophenotypical findings, the diagnosis of penile metastasis from extranodal nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma was established.\nTwenty days after neoplasm resection, the patient consented to chemotherapy treatment followed by radiotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. CHOP-L regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase) was planned to be given every 3 weeks, with six cycles in total. However, the third cycle of chemotherapy was delayed due to ascites, fever, and grade 4 myelosuppression. Subsequently, he developed tachypnea, abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. According to the CT results, His lymphoma was refractory to chemotherapy and metastases developed in the adrenal gland, liver, spleen and lymph nodes. The patient died of disease 1 month later, which is approximately 4 months after the diagnosis was made.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying image.",

No lesion in the bladder was identified upon cystoscopy. CT scans of chest and abdomen did not detect enlarged lymph nodes. The liver and spleen were of normal size and shape. Bone marrow biopsy showed lymphoma cell infiltration up to 3.2%.\nMicroscopic findings of the penile mass showed infiltration of medium-sized cells with irregular nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and many apoptotic bodies. The lymphoma cells exhibited a notable angioinfiltrative growth pattern, with homocentric arrangement around small arteries, and coagulative necrosis was also observed (Fig. ). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical cells were positive for CD3, CD56, vimentin, LCA, TIA-1, and granzyme B, but negative for cytokeratin, CD20, bcl-2, bcl-6, and ALK (Fig. ). In the case of in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER), most atypical cells were also labeled (Fig. ). These findings were consistent with NK/T-cell lymphoma.\nBy detailed history, we learned that the patient had nasal obstruction for more than 10 years. PET-CT found a high-FDG metabolic mass in the nasal cavity and the nasopharyngeal cavity. Space-occupying lesion in the nasal cavity was observed and biopsied with sinoscopy. Histological examination showed diffuse infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with angio-destructive growth pattern, and apoptotic bodies were present (Fig. ). The tumor cells were positive for CD3, CD56, EBER; they were negative for CD20 and granzyme B (Fig. . b-d). Based on the endoscopic and immunophenotypical findings, the diagnosis of penile metastasis from extranodal nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma was established.\nTwenty days after neoplasm resection, the patient consented to chemotherapy treatment followed by radiotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. CHOP-L regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase) was planned to be given every 3 weeks, with six cycles in total. However, the third cycle of chemotherapy was delayed due to ascites, fever, and grade 4 myelosuppression. Subsequently, he developed tachypnea, abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. According to the CT results, His lymphoma was refractory to chemotherapy and metastases developed in the adrenal gland, liver, spleen and lymph nodes. The patient died of disease 1 month later, which is approximately 4 months after the diagnosis was made.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying image.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 29-year-old homemaker spontaneously delivered her first child at full term in the end of September 2018 ().\nShe breast-fed the baby. Three months later, she noticed a tendency toward constipation and distress in the epigastrium. She first noticed diarrhea mixed with blood at 20 weeks postpartum (). The number of diarrhea episodes increased to 20 times/day in a few days and abdominal pain began to appear. A local doctor referred her to a tertiary care hospital, where she was hospitalized at 21 weeks postpartum ().\nHer past history was noncontributory except for palm exanthema at the age of 26. There was no family history of IBD. She reported not eating any foods that would likely cause diarrhea. Her family (husband and baby) did not have diarrhea. She did not take any supplements or medications.\nHer height was 165 cm and body weight was 60 kg. She was afebrile. Physical examination was noncontributory except for mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. Neither anal fistula nor anal skin tag was observed. Blood test disclosed a mild elevation of C-reactive protein (). Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation from the rectum to the proximal descending colon with multiple yellow-white color spots (). Ulcer was not observed. Biopsy specimens revealed crypt abscesses, goblet cell depletion, and mononuclear cell infiltration (), which were consistent with findings of UC. Stool culture for pathogen, CD Chek (Techlab C. Diff Quik Chek Complete, Techlab Inc, VA, USA), and cytomegalovirus antigenemia were negative. At this point, moderate UC (initial episode) with left-sided colitis in the extent was diagnosed. Sulfasalazine 4.0 g/day was prescribed (). Her symptoms gradually improved, then bloody stool disappeared. She was discharged after 2 weeks hospitalization. Soon after discharge, sulfasalazine was replaced by mesalazine (3.2 g/day), and she resumed breast-feeding (). Because she wanted to be free from medication, she asked her doctor to refer her to another tertiary hospital based on the information of PBD in IBD.\nShe underwent 12 days of educational hospitalization for UC at 27 weeks postpartum (). At that time, there were no symptoms. C-reactive protein was normal and fecal occult blood was negative (). A lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet (1700 kcal/day) with fish once a week and meat every other week, a kind of PBD, was provided. She experienced PBD and had a dietary guidance of PBD. Colonoscopy at the end of hospitalization revealed restoration of vascular patterns which confirmed endoscopic remission of UC (). She requested a lower dose of medication. Considering her excellent condition and our assertion that diet is generally more important than medication in the quiescent stage in IBD, the mesalazine dose was gradually decreased to 0.4 g/day on discharge (). She was advised to continue PBD after discharge.\nAn interview and questionnaire on lifestyle and dietary habits revealed a dietary change during the postpartum period. Midwives recommended Washoku for pregnancy and for lactation. Washoku is a traditional Japanese diet prevalent before dietary westernization and is similar to a presco-vegetarian diet. After delivery, she stayed at her parent’s home for about 3 months. Her mother prepared Washoku at the midwife's recommendation. She subsequently returned to her own home at 14 weeks postpartum (). She had a feeling of being released from childbirth. She prepared meals by herself. Although she was aware that the quality of the meals deteriorated, she had urges to eat sweets and cheese. She felt a tendency of constipation and distress in the epigastrium. This dietary change was assessed by plant-based diet score (PBDS). The score dropped from 25 to 9 (, ).\nAfter the educational hospitalization, she was glad to be able to resume breast-feeding. She was well, then she completely stopped taking her medication 3 weeks after discharge. Her PBDS one month after the discharge (35 weeks postpartum) was 40, the highest score (). The values of hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate became normal (). She has remained in remission without medication to the present (February 2020).\nThe patient has provided informed consent for publication of the case.",

        "title": "Management for traumatic hepatic injury diagnosed by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in a patient with an occluded coeliac axis: a case report",
        "patient": "In May 2020, a 43-year-old male patient without significant medical history was admitted to the Emergency Department, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, South Korea following a motorcycle accident that took place 3 h before. He had moderate upper abdominal pain that did not involve the entire abdomen. On physical examination, the abdomen was mildly distended and localized tenderness without rebound tenderness was identified at the upper abdomen. The patient was haemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 cycles/min and a body temperature of 36.2 °C. Laboratory tests identified mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count 12.02 × 103/µl) and abnormally high liver enzyme levels (aspartate aminotransferase 245 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase 235 IU/l) were detected; otherwise, there were no notable findings. Computed tomography (CT) revealed huge ill-defined low-density lesions involving the anterior (S5, S8) and S4 segments of the liver, suggestive of high-grade hepatic injury (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade IV), with a small amount of haemoperitoneum. The initial multidetector CT scans were performed on a 256-detector CT scanner (Revolution CT; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) within 2 h of his arrival at the Emergency Department. A total of 1.5 ml/kg body weight of nonionic contrast material (Iomeron; Bracco, Milan, Italy) was injected into an antecubital vein at a rate of 2.3 ml/s using a power injector. However, there was no definite evidence of active bleeding on the CT images (). Moreover, the root of the coeliac trunk was severely stenosed due to compression by the median arcuate ligament (MAL) () and an anomaly in which the right hepatic artery (RHA) arose from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), with the development of unique collateral vessels, was identified on a maximum-intensity projection image (). Grayscale ultrasound revealed ill-defined heterogeneous echogenic lesions suggestive of blunt injury to the liver (). A CEUS examination revealed multiple high-echogenic tubular and ovoid structures, not visible on the initial CT scan, which were suggestive of active bleeding within the injured region of the liver (). CEUS was performed using a contrast agent (Sono Vue; Bracco), which is a second-generation blood-pool contrast agent consisting of stabilized microbubbles of sulphur hexafluoride gas covered by a stabilizing phospholipidic membrane. CEUS examination was performed with an ultrasound device (LOGIQ P9; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) using a curved transducer (C1-5-RS; bandwidth: 1–6 MHz) and a coded contrast imaging software that detects the fundamental nonlinear response of the microbubbles at low mechanical index (MI: 0.14–0.16).\nThe patient was referred for emergency angiography. The aberrant RHA arising from the SMA was selected. Subsequently, angiography revealed interlobar and intrahepatic collateral vessels between the RHA and the left hepatic artery, and multiple sites of active bleeding in the liver, consistent with the CEUS findings (). A microcatheter was coaxially loaded to select the feeding arteries throughout the collateral pathway. However, catheterization of these bleeding vessels was unsuccessful due to the excessive length and severe tortuosity of the collateral pathway (). After a number of failed attempts at catheterization through the aberrant RHA arising from the SMA, a decision was made to cannulate the stenotic portion of the coeliac trunk with a 5-Fr Yashiro catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), and, after several attempts, a 1.9-Fr microcatheter (Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) was successfully advanced coaxially into the common hepatic artery (). Selective angiography of the hepatic artery revealed active bleeding () and embolization was performed with a 1:2 mixture of N-butyl cyanoacrylate and iodized oil. Post-embolization angiography was performed to confirm successful haemostasis without active bleeding, but small haemorrhages supplied by fine intrahepatic collateral vessels remained (). The clinician decided to manage the residual bleeding conservatively, given the relatively small size of the haemorrhages and the stable haemodynamics of the patient. The post-interventional course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 13th day post-intervention. In the 7 months following the procedure, the patient displayed no further clinically-evident bleeding as monitored by multidetector CT.\nThis report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, South Korea (no. CBNUH 2020-12-007) and the need for informed consent was waived. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.",

He had moderate upper abdominal pain that did not involve the entire abdomen. On physical examination, the abdomen was mildly distended and localized tenderness without rebound tenderness was identified at the upper abdomen. The patient was haemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 cycles/min and a body temperature of 36.2 °C. Laboratory tests identified mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count 12.02 × 103/µl) and abnormally high liver enzyme levels (aspartate aminotransferase 245 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase 235 IU/l) were detected; otherwise, there were no notable findings. Computed tomography (CT) revealed huge ill-defined low-density lesions involving the anterior (S5, S8) and S4 segments of the liver, suggestive of high-grade hepatic injury (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade IV), with a small amount of haemoperitoneum. The initial multidetector CT scans were performed on a 256-detector CT scanner (Revolution CT; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) within 2 h of his arrival at the Emergency Department. A total of 1.5 ml/kg body weight of nonionic contrast material (Iomeron; Bracco, Milan, Italy) was injected into an antecubital vein at a rate of 2.3 ml/s using a power injector. However, there was no definite evidence of active bleeding on the CT images (). Moreover, the root of the coeliac trunk was severely stenosed due to compression by the median arcuate ligament (MAL) () and an anomaly in which the right hepatic artery (RHA) arose from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), with the development of unique collateral vessels, was identified on a maximum-intensity projection image (). Grayscale ultrasound revealed ill-defined heterogeneous echogenic lesions suggestive of blunt injury to the liver (). A CEUS examination revealed multiple high-echogenic tubular and ovoid structures, not visible on the initial CT scan, which were suggestive of active bleeding within the injured region of the liver (). CEUS was performed using a contrast agent (Sono Vue; Bracco), which is a second-generation blood-pool contrast agent consisting of stabilized microbubbles of sulphur hexafluoride gas covered by a stabilizing phospholipidic membrane. CEUS examination was performed with an ultrasound device (LOGIQ P9; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) using a curved transducer (C1-5-RS; bandwidth: 1–6 MHz) and a coded contrast imaging software that detects the fundamental nonlinear response of the microbubbles at low mechanical index (MI: 0.14–0.16).\nThe patient was referred for emergency angiography. The aberrant RHA arising from the SMA was selected. Subsequently, angiography revealed interlobar and intrahepatic collateral vessels between the RHA and the left hepatic artery, and multiple sites of active bleeding in the liver, consistent with the CEUS findings (). A microcatheter was coaxially loaded to select the feeding arteries throughout the collateral pathway. However, catheterization of these bleeding vessels was unsuccessful due to the excessive length and severe tortuosity of the collateral pathway (). After a number of failed attempts at catheterization through the aberrant RHA arising from the SMA, a decision was made to cannulate the stenotic portion of the coeliac trunk with a 5-Fr Yashiro catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), and, after several attempts, a 1.9-Fr microcatheter (Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) was successfully advanced coaxially into the common hepatic artery (). Selective angiography of the hepatic artery revealed active bleeding () and embolization was performed with a 1:2 mixture of N-butyl cyanoacrylate and iodized oil. Post-embolization angiography was performed to confirm successful haemostasis without active bleeding, but small haemorrhages supplied by fine intrahepatic collateral vessels remained (). The clinician decided to manage the residual bleeding conservatively, given the relatively small size of the haemorrhages and the stable haemodynamics of the patient. The post-interventional course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 13th day post-intervention. In the 7 months following the procedure, the patient displayed no further clinically-evident bleeding as monitored by multidetector CT.\nThis report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, South Korea (no. CBNUH 2020-12-007) and the need for informed consent was waived. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 2-year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat presented with a 6-month history of an intermittent bilateral forelimb lameness, an intermittent ‘bunny-hopping’ hindlimb gait, difficulty with use of stairs and jumping and occasional vocalisation suspected to be pain-related. The gait was worse following rest and improved with walking. Eighteen months prior to presentation, there had been a period of right hindlimb lameness followed by a period of left hindlimb lameness that later resolved. The cat had been in the owner’s possession since the age of 12 weeks, had not left the UK, had outdoor access and was fed a complete commercial cat food. Meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q24h [Metacam; Boehringer Ingelheim]) had been used intermittently for several months prior to presentation but with limited effect.\nOn initial presentation to the neurology department, there was a right forelimb lameness at rest, which improved with walking. A mild medial patellar luxation was palpable bilaterally. Neurological examination detected a normal gait with normal postural reactions, normal spinal reflexes, normal cranial nerve testing and no pain on spinal palpation. The cat was discharged with a further course of 0.05 mg/kg meloxicam PO q24h and restricted activity was advised.\nOn follow-up examination with the orthopaedic department 8 weeks later, the cat was markedly lame on all four limbs but particularly on the forelimbs. There was alternation between toe-walking on the forelimbs with a hunched posture and using the dorsal aspect of the carpi to walk on (). The cat would hiss repeatedly when walking and would lie down tentatively, appearing happier and less painful when lying down. When not lying down, the cat preferred to sit back on the hindlimbs and non-weightbear on the forelimbs (; so-called kangaroo stance). A source of pain could not be localised on the forelimbs, but there was a repeatable pain response to palpation around the calcaneus bone and insertion of the Achilles tendon bilaterally. Differential diagnoses included a diffuse neuromuscular disease, an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or polyarthritis, or an infectious disease such as toxoplasmosis.\nHaematology was unremarkable. Serum biochemistry revealed a mild elevation in creatine kinase (237 U/l; reference interval [RI] 50–150 U/l) but was otherwise unremarkable. Serology for feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was negative. Serology for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and T gondii IgG and IgM were pending.\nThe cat was sedated with 5 µg/kg dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor; Zoetis) intravenously (IV) and 0.02 mg/kg buprenorphine (Buprecare; Animalcare) IV with a top-up of propofol (Propoflo Plus; Zoetis) IV to effect. Radiographs of the elbows and antebrachii were unremarkable. Radiographs of the tarsi revealed a small spur of bone projecting distally from the plantar aspect of the flexor surface of the left calcaneus, slight undulation to the plantar surface of the proximal calcaneal tuberosity bilaterally, and mild soft tissue swelling over the point of the calcaneal tuberosity and distal calcaneus and Achilles tendon bilaterally. These changes were considered mild and non-specific. Arthrocentesis of the left stifle, left shoulder, left carpus and left tarsus was unremarkable. A sample of bursal fluid from the right Achilles tendon revealed neutrophilic inflammation with intracytoplasmic inclusions suspected to be lupus cells or Döhle bodies (). Sedation was reversed with 50 µg/kg atipamezole (Antisedan; Zoetis) intramuscularly.\nThe cat was hospitalised prior to further investigations and received 0.02 mg/kg buprenorphine IV q6–8h and 0.05 mg/kg meloxicam PO q24h. There was no improvement with this treatment.\nAnaesthesia was induced with propofol IV to effect, following a premedication of 0.2 mg/kg methadone (Methadyne; Jurox) IV and 5 µg/kg dexmedetomidine IV and was maintained with isoflurane (IsoFlo; Zoetis) and oxygen. Cefuroxime 20 mg/kg (Zinacef; GlaxoSmithKline) IV was provided perioperatively. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies of the left tibial motor nerve, left ulnar motor nerve and left tibial sensory nerves were within normal limits. All F wave latencies were within normal limits. Sensory nerve studies were also normal. Electromyography (EMG) of the left flexor carpi ulnaris, left biceps, left supraspinatus, left gastrocnemius, left cranial tibial and left middle gluteal muscles showed increased insertional activity. The left extensor carpi radialis longus, left deltoid and the left triceps muscle showed increased spontaneous activity. The left supraspinatus muscle showed increased insertional activity and slightly increased spontaneous activity. The left palmar interossei, left semimembranosus, left biceps femoris and left quadriceps muscles showed no evidence of electrical instability.\nNCV and EMG findings were consistent with a diffuse muscular disease, worse in the proximal thoracic limb and distal pelvic limb muscles. An axonopathy without secondary myelin disturbance was considered less likely. Results from the EMG are summarised in . A sample of fluid taken from the left Achilles tendon bursa was consistent with findings from the contralateral side: neutrophilic inflammation with intracytoplasmic inclusions suspected to be lupus cells or Döhle bodies. Biopsies were taken from the right infraspinatus, right triceps brachii, right extensor carpi radialis, right cranial tibialis and right gastrocnemius muscles and submitted for histopathology and T gondii PCR. The cat was discharged from hospital with 0.05 mg/kg meloxicam PO q24h while results were pending.\nT gondii serology using an immunofluorescent antibody assay returned with a markedly elevated IgG titre of 1:1600 (RI <1:50) and borderline IgM titre of 1:25 (RI <1:25). ANA titre was negative. Clindamycin (Antirobe; Zoetis) was started at 19.2 mg/kg PO q12h and the course of 0.05 mg/kg meloxicam PO q24h continued. Histopathology of each muscle biopsy revealed a diffuse, chronic, moderate myopathy with some myofibre resorption. There was no evidence of T gondii DNA on PCR testing of the right triceps brachii muscle.\nAn improvement was seen within 3 days of starting the clindamycin. T gondii serology 2 weeks after starting the clindamycin revealed a markedly elevated IgG titre of 1:1600 and a mildly elevated IgM titre of 1:50.\nThe cat re-presented following a 6-week course of clindamycin. The owners reported an occasional forelimb lameness, but otherwise there had been significant improvement. The cat was more sociable, would play with the other in its home cat and had stopped vocalising. On examination, the cat was walking relatively normally. There was no toe-walking, no walking on the dorsal aspect of the carpi and no sitting back on the hindlimbs. There was mild enlargement of the Achilles tendon bursae, more so on the right, with some resentment on palpation. An ophthalmological examination detected a small chorioretinal scar that could be compatible with a toxoplasmosis lesion; there was no evidence of active lesions and no ophthalmic nerve pathology. The clindamycin was stopped, and meloxicam continued at the same dose for a further 3 weeks. T gondii serology repeated 13 weeks after finishing the clindamycin revealed a positive IgG titre of 1:400 and a normal IgM titre of 1:20.\nThe cat was presented for a follow-up examination 20 months after the cessation of treatment. The owners reported there was full resolution of clinical signs 3 months from the start of the clindamycin. The cat had not received any medication since that time and there had been no recurrence of clinical signs. On examination, the gait was normal with no signs of lameness (see in the ). The cat could jump up and down from a chair and consultation table normally (see in the ). There was mild irregularity on palpation of the point of the calcaneus bilaterally, but no swelling of the Achilles tendon bursae and no patellar luxation. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.",

        "patient": "A 51-year-old male presented with epigastric pain and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at an outside facility. Despite fluid resuscitation, there was no improvement and he was transferred to our hospital the following day. His medical history was remarkable for hypertension and hyperuricemia. He drinks alcohol (56 g) every day. Physical examination revealed temperature 36.4 °C, blood pressure 138/101 mmHg, pulse 121/min, and respiratory rate 22/min. He was in acute distress with tenderness in the epigastrium without rebound tenderness. Laboratory data included white blood cell (WBC) count of 11,900/μl, serum creatinine 2.28 mg/dl, total bilirubin 1.14 mg/dl and C-reactive protein 32 mg/dl. Serum lipase was 894 U/L. Computed tomography scan showed peripancreatic and a mesocolic fluid collection classified as Balthazar grade E.\nOn the day of admission, aggressive fluid resuscitation continued for the treatment of pancreatitis. With continued tachycardia and respiratory failure (SpO2 88% mask 5 L), he was brought to the intensive care unit (ICU) and supported with mechanical ventilation. By hospital day 5, there was improvement in the respiratory failure and renal failure. He was extubated and left the ICU to a general ward on hospital day 13. Although the patient appeared to be in no distress, the fever and elevated WBC continued after leaving the ICU. On hospital day 23 a CT scan was obtained which showed a gas and fluid collection in the left retroperitoneum. There was no contrast in one segment of the wall of the descending colon and perforation was suspected. To confirm the perforation, a contrast enema was performed after the CT scan which showed extraluminal contrast adjacent to the descending colon (). This conformed the diagnosis of a perforation of the descending colon.\nTo control leakage from the perforation, retroperitoneal drainage was established by placing a 28Fr catheter percutaneously. As the drain was inserted, feculent material spontaneously drained, with a total of 700 mL. To control the leak, a loop ileostomy was performed for diversion () on hospital day 34. After the diversion, discharge from the retroperitoneal drain decreased but fever persisted. A CT scan at that time revealed ascites. A 12Fr catheter was placed through the abdominal wall and water soluble contrast injected which demonstrated a duodenal fistula (). The fever resolved after drainage of the ascites. Previously placed drains in the retroperitoneum were removed after the volume of discharge decreased and the patient was discharged on hospital day 106.",

        "title": "Asymptomatic Dialysate Turbidity and Repeated Intraductal Clots in a Peritoneal Dialysis Patient",
        "patient": "A 43-year-old woman developed end-stage renal disease due to chronic glomerulonephritis and underwent surgery to insert a Tenckhoff PD catheter in January 2012. She weighed 65 kg and measured 165 cm (BMI 23.8). The blood pressure was controlled in the ideal range (130–40/80–90 mm Hg), with a heart rate of approximately 80 bpm. Her dialysis scheme was strictly according to the standard continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD), including 2 L of 1.5% PD solution with three exchanges daily and 2 L of 2.5% PD solution overnight. The ultrafiltration volume was 500–800 mL, and urine output was 800–1,000 mL/24 h. She denied any history of allergic disease, including bronchial asthma or food sensitivity. In general, her CAPD therapy had gone well over the past 2 years, and no PD-related peritonitis had ever occurred.\nThe woman presented cloudy peritoneal effluent without any symptoms from May 2014. The effluent cytological test and microorganism culture were performed before the administration of antibiotics. The cytological test result showed a karyocyte count of 630 × 106/L with 80% polynuclear cells; however, the microorganism culture was negative. Despite a diagnostic antibiotic treatment with an intraperitoneal injection of cefazolin (250 mg/change) combined with amikacin (25 mg/change) for 2 weeks, the effluent remained turbid. Thence, the antibiotic regimen was changed to intraperitoneal injection of ceftazidime and vancomycin for 21 days. However, there was no improvement in the turbidity.\nTherefore, the patient was hospitalized in July 2014. After admission, a careful physical examination showed no rash or purpura. Abdominal palpation revealed no tenderness, tension, or rebound pain. The only abnormal finding was a small black spot adhering inside the external part of the Tenckhoff catheter. The blood routine examination showed a white blood cell count of 3.8 × 109/L, with 32.2% eosinophils. There were 500 × 106/L nucleated cells in the peritoneal effluent, with 87% eosinophils. The effluent culture still showed no growth of bacteria or fungi, and it was negative for the acid-fast stain. Serum tumor markers, serum immunological markers such as antinuclear antibody, extractable nuclear antigen, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and blood allergen tests were all negative. Enhanced computed tomography did not reveal any signs of malignancy in the chest or abdomen. Additionally, there was a slight elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Table ). As the patient remained asymptomatic, the antibiotic treatment was then stopped. Given that there was a significant elevation of eosinophils in the peritoneal effluent, with a ratio of 87% and an absolute eosinophil count of >30/mm3 (up to 435/mm3), we initially diagnosed the patient with iEP []. Cytological and etiological examinations, including peripheral blood and effluent cell count, effluent bacteria, fungi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection and cultivation, were then repeated several times. (Table ; Fig. ).\nAfter a diagnosis of iEP, ketotifen (1 mg/day) was administered to the patient along with a low-dose prednisone (20 mg/day) therapy. One day later, the effluent became clear. The oral corticosteroid was rapidly reduced and stopped within 2 weeks, but the effluent immediately became turbid again after the suspension of prednisone. We therefore started another course of prednisone (still 20 mg/day), which was tapered and stopped over an 8-week period. During the treatment, she did not feel any abdominal pain and the effluent was still clear. In September 2014, the effluent cytological test showed the polynuclear cell count had decreased to 1 × 106/L, with no eosinophils (Fig. ).\nSteroid treatment was terminated because of the adverse effects of prednisone, including insomnia and gastrointestinal discomfort. As we expected, the turbid effluent reappeared. For personal reasons, she refused the suggestion of transferring to hemodialysis. PD therapy was continued without any complaints of discomfort. The white blood cell count in the effluent throughout varied within the range of 200–300 × 106/L (Fig. ). It was notable that the small black spot inside the catheter gradually grew larger. In June 2015, the speck ultimately formed a clot, which almost completely blocked the catheter and caused catheter dysfunction. Therefore, we had to remove the external portion of the Tenckhoff catheter.\nAfter surgery, the patient continued PD therapy for 6 months, but the situation gradually reoccurred.

After the patient agreed to transfer to hemodialysis, the Tenckhoff catheter was removed immediately. During surgery, we found that there were several clots inside the internal catheter as well (Fig. ). The removed catheter was sent for pathological examination and bacterial/fungal culture.

She weighed 65 kg and measured 165 cm (BMI 23.8). The blood pressure was controlled in the ideal range (130–40/80–90 mm Hg), with a heart rate of approximately 80 bpm. Her dialysis scheme was strictly according to the standard continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD), including 2 L of 1.5% PD solution with three exchanges daily and 2 L of 2.5% PD solution overnight. The ultrafiltration volume was 500–800 mL, and urine output was 800–1,000 mL/24 h. She denied any history of allergic disease, including bronchial asthma or food sensitivity. In general, her CAPD therapy had gone well over the past 2 years, and no PD-related peritonitis had ever occurred.\nThe woman presented cloudy peritoneal effluent without any symptoms from May 2014. The effluent cytological test and microorganism culture were performed before the administration of antibiotics. The cytological test result showed a karyocyte count of 630 × 106/L with 80% polynuclear cells; however, the microorganism culture was negative. Despite a diagnostic antibiotic treatment with an intraperitoneal injection of cefazolin (250 mg/change) combined with amikacin (25 mg/change) for 2 weeks, the effluent remained turbid. Thence, the antibiotic regimen was changed to intraperitoneal injection of ceftazidime and vancomycin for 21 days. However, there was no improvement in the turbidity.\nTherefore, the patient was hospitalized in July 2014. After admission, a careful physical examination showed no rash or purpura. Abdominal palpation revealed no tenderness, tension, or rebound pain. The only abnormal finding was a small black spot adhering inside the external part of the Tenckhoff catheter. The blood routine examination showed a white blood cell count of 3.8 × 109/L, with 32.2% eosinophils. There were 500 × 106/L nucleated cells in the peritoneal effluent, with 87% eosinophils. The effluent culture still showed no growth of bacteria or fungi, and it was negative for the acid-fast stain. Serum tumor markers, serum immunological markers such as antinuclear antibody, extractable nuclear antigen, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and blood allergen tests were all negative. Enhanced computed tomography did not reveal any signs of malignancy in the chest or abdomen. Additionally, there was a slight elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Table ). As the patient remained asymptomatic, the antibiotic treatment was then stopped. Given that there was a significant elevation of eosinophils in the peritoneal effluent, with a ratio of 87% and an absolute eosinophil count of >30/mm3 (up to 435/mm3), we initially diagnosed the patient with iEP []. Cytological and etiological examinations, including peripheral blood and effluent cell count, effluent bacteria, fungi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection and cultivation, were then repeated several times. (Table ; Fig. ).\nAfter a diagnosis of iEP, ketotifen (1 mg/day) was administered to the patient along with a low-dose prednisone (20 mg/day) therapy. One day later, the effluent became clear. The oral corticosteroid was rapidly reduced and stopped within 2 weeks, but the effluent immediately became turbid again after the suspension of prednisone. We therefore started another course of prednisone (still 20 mg/day), which was tapered and stopped over an 8-week period. During the treatment, she did not feel any abdominal pain and the effluent was still clear. In September 2014, the effluent cytological test showed the polynuclear cell count had decreased to 1 × 106/L, with no eosinophils (Fig. ).\nSteroid treatment was terminated because of the adverse effects of prednisone, including insomnia and gastrointestinal discomfort. As we expected, the turbid effluent reappeared. For personal reasons, she refused the suggestion of transferring to hemodialysis. PD therapy was continued without any complaints of discomfort. The white blood cell count in the effluent throughout varied within the range of 200–300 × 106/L (Fig. ). It was notable that the small black spot inside the catheter gradually grew larger. In June 2015, the speck ultimately formed a clot, which almost completely blocked the catheter and caused catheter dysfunction. Therefore, we had to remove the external portion of the Tenckhoff catheter.\nAfter surgery, the patient continued PD therapy for 6 months, but the situation gradually reoccurred. Another clot formed (Fig. ), and catheter dysfunction occurred again. The leukocytes in the peritoneal effluent increased to 8.4 × 108/L with 60% eosinophils, although she was still asymptomatic. After the patient agreed to transfer to hemodialysis, the Tenckhoff catheter was removed immediately. During surgery, we found that there were several clots inside the internal catheter as well (Fig. ). The removed catheter was sent for pathological examination and bacterial/fungal culture. To our surprise, the pathological examination revealed that the clots consisted of innumerable fungal spores and hyphae as well as eosinophils (Fig. ). Although the microorganism culture of the catheter was still negative, the patient was eventually diagnosed with EP secondary to fungal infection.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 19-year-old woman visited our clinic, presenting with swelling of the neck for past few days. A physical examination revealed many enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of her neck. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed a leukocyte count of 7.5 × 109/L, of which neutrophils and lymphocytes accounted for 63.2% and 28.9%, respectively; a hemoglobin count of 13.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 239 × 109/L. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes with central necrosis at the neck levels II, III, and V, and in the retropharyngeal space (). Fine needle aspiration of the right cervical lymph node revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with necrosis, which was consistent with that observed in tuberculosis. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli, and tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. AFB culture of lymph node tissue was not performed. The patient tested seronegative for HIV, and her chest X-ray indicated no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with tuberculous lymphadenitis and treated with a drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nAt 5 weeks, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of enlarged cervical lymph nodes and breathing difficulty. She complained of dyspnea and appeared tachypneic. Her respiration rate was 25/min. A physical examination revealed an enlarged lymph node on the right side of her neck and protrusion of the retropharyngeal wall blocking the pharyngeal space. A neck CT obtained at time of admission revealed the enlarged retropharyngeal lymph node with central necrosis, which had also been observed previously. This lymph node protruded into the pharyngeal space, blocking the airway (). Her dyspnea did not improve despite oxygen therapy. Therefore, tracheostomy was performed as an emergency measure to resolve the narrowing of the airway and to prevent its imminent obstruction, following which the retropharyngeal lymph node was incised and drained. At the time of surgery, tissue culture was negative. AFB smear examination and culture also yielded negative results. The patient's antituberculous medications were continued, and the same regimen used previously was followed. In addition, ceftizoxime 2.0 g/day was administered for 2 weeks. The tracheostomy site was sealed at 2 weeks. The enlarged cervical lymph nodes decreased in size with continued antituberculous therapy. At 2 months, the drug regimen was altered to isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol. At 5 months, the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged and fluctuant, necessitating lymph node aspiration. The results of AFB stain and AFB culture were negative. The enlarged lymph nodes decreased further in size and resolved without any modification in the medication. At 11 months, the right supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, and the AFB stain and culture of fine needle aspirates were also negative. The lymph node enlargement improved with the continuation of the same antituberculous regimen administered previously. Antituberculous treatment was continued for 1 year and 2 months.",

        "patient": "The first patient is a previously healthy 19-year-old male diagnosed with CP and hydrocephalus and treated with extensive tumor resection at the age 18 years (Fig. a). Subsequently, panhypopituitarism (diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, GH deficiency), necessitating hormone replacement therapy, and hyperphagia and obesity (Body Mass Index, BMI, increased from 25.1 to 41.0 in less than 2 years) occurred. Besides, episodes characterized by psychomotor slowing, sometimes followed by upper limbs afinalistic movements, and episodes of sudden muscle tone loss of the lower limbs appeared and were diagnosed as epileptic seizures in another Neurological Center. However, antiepileptic treatments with phenobarbital, lacosamide, and phenytoin were not followed by a clinical improvement and clinical manifestations worsened over the following months. At first examination in our center, a marked daytime sleepiness with frequent daytime naps, fragmented night sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations and sudden loss of muscle tone while awake were recognized. These lasts occurred in the absence of any evident trigger, such as laughing. Moreover, episodes characterized by bimanual automatic gestures occurring during state of somnolence were reported. In addition, during the medical evaluation, the patient experienced an episode characterized by psychomotor slowing, closing of the eyes, broad movements of the upper limbs, and hardly understandable speech; he seemed to understand the examiner’s questions but did not answer. The clinical evaluation revealed a BMI of 41 and a Mallampati score Class 2.\nThe presence of symptoms suggestive of sleep disturbances and the occurrence of events that did not resemble epileptic seizures but seemed to be due to sudden falls asleep sometimes associated with hallucinatory phenomena, led to a targeted sleep study.\nThe diagnostic work-up included actigraphy recording for 12 days, which demonstrated irregular bedtimes, frequent night-time activity, and inappropriate daytime rest episodes (Fig. ). The subjective sleepiness assessment using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [] fit with subjective hypersomnolence (ESS total score = 19, values > 10 are suggestive of excessive daytime sleepiness). Long-term polysomnography (PSG) lasting 24 h confirmed hypersomnia (13.9 h of total sleep over 24 h), frequent daytime sleep episodes, ranging from a few seconds to several minutes (maximum 100 min) with two sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs), and prolonged episodes of reduced alertness corresponding to clear-cut sleep onset in the NREM sleep N1 stage (Fig. ), in the absence of any interictal and ictal epileptic abnormalities. Many of these manifestations were marked in the seizure diary by the mother as corresponding to those reported in the medical history. Therefore, clinical and neurophysiological data allowed to exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.\nMoreover, PSG analysis revealed a severe sleep-related breathing disorder with multiple obstructive apneas, central apneas and hypopneas (Apnea Hypopnea Index -AHI- 50/h; central AHI 40/h, obstructive AHI 10/h) generally associated with desaturation (Oxygen Desaturation Index -ODI- 55/h) mostly occurring during REM sleep. The average SpO2 was 95.6%, time spent with SpO2 < 90% equal to 23.8 min, minimum oxygen saturation value 80%.\nTranscutaneous capnography showed a median PCO2 of 42.2 mmHg, time spent with PCO2 > 50 mmHg 0 min, thus excluding nocturnal hypoventilation.",

Therefore, clinical and neurophysiological data allowed to exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.\nMoreover, PSG analysis revealed a severe sleep-related breathing disorder with multiple obstructive apneas, central apneas and hypopneas (Apnea Hypopnea Index -AHI- 50/h; central AHI 40/h, obstructive AHI 10/h) generally associated with desaturation (Oxygen Desaturation Index -ODI- 55/h) mostly occurring during REM sleep. The average SpO2 was 95.6%, time spent with SpO2 < 90% equal to 23.8 min, minimum oxygen saturation value 80%.\nTranscutaneous capnography showed a median PCO2 of 42.2 mmHg, time spent with PCO2 > 50 mmHg 0 min, thus excluding nocturnal hypoventilation.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "The present case is a 26-year-old woman. One year prior to the current admission, in an ultrasonography study, a well-defined lobular mass (78 × 28 × 33 mm in size) with a hypoechoic content in the posteroinferior of right kidney and a univesicular cyst of 105 × 98 × 73 mm in the lower pole of left kidney causing mild hydronephrosis had been reported (). The internal structure of the left mass was anechoic, and the cystic wall was thin and relatively regular. No alteration in the wall's structure, which could resemble a germinative membrane, was apparent.\nIn noncontrast CT-scan, the right mass had been hypodense and it was heterogeneously enhanced following contrast injection and a large cortical cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney with thin peripheral contrast enhancement without any other organ involvement ().\nThere had been no urinary symptom, gross hematuria, headache, sweating, flushing, or tachycardia. Physical exam had been normal, and abdominal masses had not been palpable.\nHer medical history was also unremarkable, and no family history of hydatid disease was identified.\nMedical laboratory tests including CBC, urinalysis, urine culture, and blood chemistries had been all in normal range. The patient had not been referred due to the lack of any symptom until feeling occasional mild and vague pain in her right flank from 2 to 3 months prior to the current admission.\nIn the second admission, no significant change in the masses was observed and all medical laboratory tests were normal. Histologic study following ultrasound-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of the right retroperitoneal mass revealed benign schwannoma (). Open surgery with right subcostal flank approach was performed to remove the mass (). A well-encapsulated tumor in the right retroperitoneal region and anterior part of psoas muscle next to the inferior pole of the right kidney without any adhesion was observed. The tumor was enucleated and excised easily (Figures and ). There was no intraoperative lymphadenopathy or bleeding.\nRadiologic findings led us to drain the cyst percutaneously with the diagnosis of left simple renal cyst.\nAfter three month, using local anesthesia, the cyst was punctured with an 18-gauge Chiba needle under ultrasound guidance; 120 mL clear fluid was aspirated. Then 50 mL of 95% ethanol (40% of the cyst volume) were injected into the cavity. The ethanol was left for 20 min following which all ethanol was aspirated and the needle was withdrawn. Biochemical and cytological analysis of the cyst was unremarkable and culture was negative.\nNo evidence of retroperitoneal tumor recurrence and no significant change in the left renal cyst were observed in the ultrasound followup performed three months later.\nBecause the left mass was diagnosed as a large simple renal cyst, an operation with flank position was planned. At exploration, the large cystic mass in the lower pole of the left kidney presented with a regular but thick wall. Aspiration of the cystic fluid was down. It was like clear water. When the cystic wall was opened, sloughed and wrinkled daughter cysts were seen. After taking precaution to prevent hydatid seeding, by means of sponges saturated with povidone iodine, the daughter cysts were extracted. The internal surface of the cyst wall was washed with povidone iodine, and cystectomy was performed, leaving a portion of the cyst wall at the renal side.\nFollowup at 6 months and 1 year with ultrasonography revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence or hydatid disease in the perinephric space from spillage of the hydatid fluid.",

There was no personal or family history of cardiac disease, he was neither diabetic nor hypertensive, and had a normal serum cholesterol level (2.5 mmol/l). Although he initially denied illicit drug use, a third party confirmed he had smoked “Black Mamba” within three hours of the onset of his symptoms.\nHe initially reported left-sided chest pain, associated with dizziness and dyspnoea. Minutes later, the patient collapsed, cardiac output became undetectable, and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was commenced. Out-of-hospital cardiac monitoring revealed ventricular fibrillation, and spontaneous circulation was restored after delivery of four direct current shocks. During transfer to hospital, ECG demonstrated ST elevation in antero-lateral leads (Fig. ), and the patient was admitted directly for cardiac catheterisation. The serum Troponin-T level was recorded at 4398 ng/L (normal range <14 ng/L on high-sensitivity Troponin-T), confirming the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.\nCoronary angiography revealed an ostial occlusion to the left anterior descending artery, which was treated by thrombectomy. There was some residual stenosis, which could have represented mild coronary artery disease or persistent vasospasm. As it did not respond to nitrate treatment, a Xience drug-eluting stent (Abbott) was placed. The left circumflex and right coronary arteries were angiographically normal, and there were only mild irregularities in an intermediate artery. The patient experienced no further symptoms of cardiac ischemia, and the ST elevation resolved after percutaneous coronary intervention. He was discharged with anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for one year, aspirin 75 mg daily for life) and secondary prevention for coronary artery disease (atorvastatin 80 mg daily, bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily and perindopril 2 mg daily).\nUrine toxicology tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines (both given on admission to hospital), and also for adamantyl-group synthetic cannabinoids.

The patient experienced no further symptoms of cardiac ischemia, and the ST elevation resolved after percutaneous coronary intervention. He was discharged with anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for one year, aspirin 75 mg daily for life) and secondary prevention for coronary artery disease (atorvastatin 80 mg daily, bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily and perindopril 2 mg daily).\nUrine toxicology tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines (both given on admission to hospital), and also for adamantyl-group synthetic cannabinoids. Other drugs of abuse were not detected, including cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines. Drugs were assayed by liquid tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and confirmed by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy.''' \n\n output:"

She had been discharged 10 days earlier following treatment for a lower respiratory tract infection. In view of her deterioration, her GP was concerned that her decline may have been attributable to an occult infection or neoplasm. She was observed to have bilateral pitting oedema. On assessment in hospital, the patient was described as being \"cushingoid\" in appearance, and there was generalised crepitus on abdominal palpation to the infra-mammary region. The remainder of the clinical examination was unremarkable.\nA CT scan was requested to define the aetiology of the clinical findings. The CT scan demonstrated a hugely distended bladder with an air fluid level and intramural gas (Figure ). In addition, gas was observed in several other bodily compartments; in the anterior abdominal wall (Figure ), intra-abdominal but extra-peritoneal (no free intraperitoneal gas), infra-peritoneal (within the pelvis), and the femoral canal (Figure ).\nA urine culture grew Escherichia coli (E. coli), and on the basis of sensitivities the patient was started on a course of gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. Over the ensuing 2 days she continued to deteriorate, and the white cell count remained raised (WCC 13.5 × 109/l). On the advice of the on-call surgical team and the consultant microbiologist, the antibiotic regimen was changed to intravenous ceftazidine and metronidazole with oral cefalexin. Although it was a possibility, there was no evidence to suggest the presence of an enterovesical fistula, and her physical frailty precluded invasive investigation.\nThree days later she developed right-sided pneumonia, for which she was started on a course of oral clarithromycin.

        "title": "Hypopyon after Primary Cryopreserved Amniotic Membrane Transplantation for Sterile Corneal Ulceration: A Case Report and Review of the Literature",
        "patient": "A 71-year-old male patient with a persistent central corneal epithelial defect and stromal thinning of 5 mm diameter on his right eye with no evidence of infection or corneal neuropathy was intermittently responsive to conservative topical treatment with antibiotic drops and ointment, intensive lubricating drops, and bandage contact lenses. The central cornea had a thinner area of 2 mm diameter with only 1/3 of the stroma remaining before Descemet's membrane and showed no sign of healing with only intermittent epithelialization despite the conservative treatment for over eight weeks from presentation. There was no evidence of corneal hypesthesia, and repeated corneal swabs for microbiology investigation proved the sterility of the lesion. The clinical suspicion of corneal rubbing against the pillow because of his sleeping preference on his right side was the most probable cause of his condition.\nAs counselling for his sleep pattern and conservative lubricating treatment had no effect, we proceeded with surgical management of his corneal defect using cryopreserved AM. We followed our previously described standard technique for corneal surface reconstruction with the membrane placed over the whole cornea [].\nFollowing peribulbar and subconjunctival anaesthesia, we carefully debrided the thinner crater and scraped off the corneal epithelium up to the limbal margin followed by a 360° conjunctival peritomy (Figures and ). Small cut pieces of AM were used to fill the stroma defect level with the surface, and a larger piece was trimmed to cover the whole corneal and limbal area with the epithelial side down used (“sticky” stroma side up) as a patch for a healthy corneal epithelium to grow underneath. We secured the membrane under the conjunctival edges with a continuous 10.0 nylon suture (). Finally, we applied a subconjunctival injection of a mixture of dexamethasone and gentamycin and placed a bandage contact lens for 2 to 3 weeks (). Our routine postoperative regimen was combined steroid and antibiotic eye drops 6 times daily for two weeks tapering down thereafter.\nFor deep corneal ulceration, we use small pieces of AM to fill the stroma defect placed as grafts with epithelial side up aiming at subepithelial or transepithelial integration of the membrane in relation to the newly formed epithelium. Following limbal peritomy, a large piece of AM is placed as a patch with the epithelial side down covering the entire cornea and limbal area, aiming at superficial localization (disintegration) of this covering piece of amniotic membrane. In theory, this arrangement will facilitate the growth of a new, healthy corneal epithelium from the intact limbal area under the superficial layer of AM but over the small pieces of AM covering the stroma defect [, ]. We have abandoned the technique of using a smaller than the corneal diameter piece of AM as a graft (epithelium up) which is sutured on to the cornea within the limbus so that the newly formed epithelium will grow over the membrane as less effective and more traumatic for the cornea [].\nThe AM graft was prepared and cryopreserved by our local eye bank using the Good Tissue Banking Practice procedures []. Despite the tested sterility of the ocular surface, the preoperative antibiotic treatment, and the uneventful perioperative period, he developed a 2 mm hypopyon within 48 hours when we reviewed him after primary AMT (). He was using our routine regimen of tobramycin 3 mg/ml and dexamethasone 1 mg/ml eye drops six times daily on a fixed combination.\nDespite the alarming clinical presentation, there were no anterior chamber reaction and no signs of active infection; therefore, we considered the hypopyon formation being a sterile toxic or immunologic reaction. To confirm this diagnosis, we took a surface swab from the membrane and performed a full microbiological examination of the residual membrane and its culture medium which we always keep for up to 7 days for quality control which were proven negative.\nThe patient continued with our standard post-AMT treatment with increased dosage every two hours for three days, followed by 6 times daily for two more weeks tapering down thereafter. The hypopyon resolved completely with the current treatment a week later with no further complications or anterior chamber reaction ().\nThe epithelial defect and corneal thinning healed satisfactorily with smooth epithelium and a visible stromal scar with no recurrence or hypopyon 5 weeks postoperatively (Figures and ).",

        "title": "Herpes zoster sciatica mimicking lumbar canal stenosis: a case report",
        "patient": "A 74-year-old Chinese man sought evaluation at our hospital for left-sided sciatic pain upon standing or walking for 5 min of approximately 1 month’s duration. At the first visit to our hospital, there were no skin lesions. On physical examination, sciatic pain provocation was observed by extension and left bending of the trunk. There was no apparent motor weakness, sensory disturbance, or vesico-rectal disturbance. Bilateral dorsalis pedis artery pulsations were palpable bilaterally. The patient claimed that he was able to ride a bicycle for approximately 1 h.\nA plain X-ray showed slight anterior listhesis of the 4th lumbar (L4) vertebral body (Fig. a) without instability on a flexion/extension lateral X-ray. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed spinal canal stenosis between the 4th and 5th lumbar spine (L4/5) level and redundant nerve roots superior to the most stenotic level (Fig. b, c). Thus, we diagnosed the patient with sciatica induced by spinal canal stenosis.\nWe treated the patient with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Because NSAIDS had a minimal effect, a caudal epidural block was attempted using a mixture of a local anesthetic (lidocaine) and steroid. The caudal epidural block provided symptom relief for a few days.\nBecause repeated caudal epidural blocks (twice in 2 weeks) failed to relieve the symptoms, we considered decompressive surgery for the L4/5 level of stenosis. At that time, the patient complained of a skin rash involving his left foot for several days. A vesicular rash and erythema were observed on the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the great toe and lateral malleolus (Fig. ). There were no skin rashes involving the buttock, thigh, and lower leg. Pain was diffusely localized to the left foot, lower leg, and lateral thigh. The magnitude of pain was severe, even at rest (85/100 mm on a visual analogue scale of 100 mm). Thus, we consulted a dermatologist in our hospital. The patient was diagnosed with herpes zoster in the left L5 area based on clinical findings, including the characteristics of the pain (along the L5 area) and vesicular rash and erythema in the L5 dermatome.\nThe patient was treated with famciclovir (1,500 mg/day) and NSAIDs. After 1 week of medication, the skin rash resolved and pain relief was obtained.",

        "patient": "An 11-year-old female patient reported to the department of pediatric dentistry with the chief complaint of pain and swelling over the lower right back tooth region for 3 months. The patient had taken medication for the same, but there was no cure. History revealed that the patient was apparently normal 3 months back; slowly the patient started experiencing pain which was intermittent in nature and dull aching type and pain was aggravating on touching the affected side and relieved on taking analgesics. Following this, the patient developed swelling in the right lower one-third of the face 2 months back. The patient had visited a primary health center, where medications were given, and the patient was referred to our department for further investigation and treatment. On extraoral examination, swelling was noted on the right lower one-third of the face extending anteroposteriorly from the angle of the mouth to the angle of the mandible and from ala-tragus line to the lower border of the mandible. No abnormalities were seen on the skin and mucous membrane. On palpation, the swelling was hard in consistency and was tender on palpation. The right submandibular lymph nodes were palpable, mobile and nontender.\nIntraoral examination showed a small (1 cm × 1.5 cm size), single, bony hard, nontender swelling in the mandibular right primary second molar region with obliteration of the buccal vestibule []. The teeth in the affected region were noncarious. The involved tooth was vital and nontender on percussion. There was no associated tooth mobility and any purulent discharge, and the patient's oral hygiene was good. The orthopantomogram [] examination revealed an approximately 1–1.5 cm radiopaque mass attached to the distal root of the primary right mandibular second molar, and it was well demarcated by a radiolucent halo. The observed clinical and radiographic findings led us to the provisional diagnosis of benign cementoblastoma. The clinical differential diagnosis included juvenile ossifying fibroma, osteoma, osteoblastoma, odontoma, periapical cemental dysplasia, condensing osteitis and hypercementosis.\nThe surgical excision of the tumor along with the extraction of the associated primary molar under general anesthesia was planned. Pediatrician's opinion was taken regarding the general health and fitness of the patient. The surgical excision was carried out by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon with the help of an anesthesiologist. At the time of surgery, the lesion could be easily differentiated from the normal bone [] and was removed along with the involved tooth. The surgical wound was closed by suturing. The excised tissue was irregularly shaped, white-colored structure with rough surface, hard in consistency and 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm × 0.5 cm in size []. The specimen was sent to histopathological examination.\nThe microscopic examination of H and E-stained (×10) section showed trabeculae of cementum-like calcified material lined by cementoblasts in the background of loose vascular connective tissue []. The center of the lesion showed trabeculae exhibiting reversal lines and numerous lacunar spaces filled with cementocytes. At the periphery of the lesion, radiating columns of unmineralized matrix oriented perpendicular to the connective tissue capsule were seen; in few areas, multinucleated cementoclast-like giant cells were also seen.\nThus, the final diagnosis of benign cementoblastoma was confirmed. The patient was recalled for regular clinical and radiographic follow-up. On 6-month follow-up, clinical and orthopantomogram [] evaluation showed satisfactory healing without any signs of recurrence. The eruption path of the underlying second premolar was normal.",

        "patient": "A 54-year-old male with a past ocular history of angioid streaks and peripapillary geographic atrophy of both eyes presented for the treatment of a juxtafoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) in the left eye. The CNVM had developed six months prior to his presentation to the clinic. He had been treated by an outside retina surgeon with two injections of bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent that is commonly used to combat CNVM. His past medical history was significant for obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye, and he had an afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. Dilated fundus exam demonstrated geographic atrophy and angioid streaks in both eyes, as well as a CNVM in the left eye. Macular optical coherence tomography demonstrated retinal atrophy in both eyes, loss of inner segment/outer segment junction in both eyes, and a small amount of intraretinal fluid in the left eye (Figure ). After discussing with the patient, the decision was made to keep him under observation for the long term.\nAfter two years of stability, the patient started to complain of glare and haloes, which correlated with his worsening cataract in the left eye. He underwent uncomplicated cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in the left eye. His visual acuity in the left eye improved to 20/40. Three months after cataract surgery, his vision worsened to 20/60 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left. He also started to complain of worsening scotomas in the left eye, decreased color vision, and intractable headaches. A month later, he developed new flashes of light and floaters in both eyes. Multiple dilated fundus exams demonstrated stability to his initial exam. Given his worsening symptoms, a full-field electroretinogram was performed, which demonstrated extinguished scotopic and photopic responses in both eyes, indicating photoreceptor damage. Over the next few months, his vision worsened to 20/400 in both eyes.\nA systemic investigation into the underlying cause of his CNVM and optic neuropathy was pursued. Laboratory testing demonstrated an elevated nicotine level of 24.7 ng/mL (reference interval: <2 ng/mL) and elevated cotinine level of 280.2 ng/mL (reference interval: <20 ng/mL). The remainder of a toxicology screen was negative. Vitamin B12, folate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, antinuclear antibody screen, complete blood count, and complete metabolic panel were all within normal limits (Table ). MRI of the brain and orbits did not demonstrate any abnormalities. During clinic visits, he was consistently noticed to be chewing tobacco; he admitted to over 40 years of frequent chewing-tobacco use. He reported that he chewed approximately 70 grams of snuff daily. His preferred brand contains 3.8 mg/g of nicotine, resulting in approximately 266 grams of daily nicotine exposure. He also reported heavy alcohol use, with two drinks per day during the weekdays, and two to four drinks of hard liquor daily over the weekend. Ultimately, he was diagnosed with toxic optic neuropathy and choroidal neovascularization due to excessive tobacco and alcohol use. He was counseled to decrease his use of toxic substances, and he is currently working with his primary care physician on tobacco and alcohol use reduction.",

Following the administration of the second dose, she also complained of headache, nausea, myalgias, arthralgias, and malaise lasting for two days only, and treated with four doses of paracetamol.\nIn addition, she presented an erythematous reaction followed by pain, induration, and mild edema at her BCG scar site (Figure ) 36 hours after receiving the second dose. Complementary laboratories, such as HIV-ELISA, CBC, and flow cytometry, were performed to discard any potential immunodeficiencies in both cases. All results were normal (Table ).\nFurthermore, a dermatological evaluation was performed by a dermatologist, describing a dermatosis affecting the proximal right upper extremity with an erythematous BCG scar of 10 x 12 mm, three centimeters from the injection site; moreover, a dermoscopy (by using a Dermlite® II Pro polarized light dermatoscope; 3Gen Inc., San Juan Capistrano, CA) was performed on the BCG scar, identifying a hypochromic stellar pattern with \"arborizing\" and \"comma-shaped\" vessels (Figure ). The reaction lasted for two days with no further affection.''' \n\n output:"

        "patient": "A 42-year-old male was referred to the department with a chief complaint of mild pain and tenderness to biting pressure in the right lower posterior region. Dental history revealed an attempted root canal treatment by a general dentist 6 months before. On examination, the mandibular right molar was found to have a temporary filling material. The tooth was tender to percussion and had a draining sinus tract on the buccal mucosa. There was a localized 6 mm deep periodontal pocket adjacent to the buccal furcation. Radiographic examination revealed independent radiolucent lesions at the apex of the mesial root and in the furcation region [].\nThe presence of the periodontal pocket and associated furcal destruction were suspicious signs of perforation at the mesiobuccal root of tooth no. 30. The treatment of perforation with MTA-Angelus was planned. After the patient was administered with local anesthetic, the temporary filling material was removed from the pulp chamber revealing profuse bleeding from the chamber. The chamber was irrigated with 3% NaOCl, and bleeding was controlled. Canals were dried with paper point. Hemorrhage was located along the side of the paper point in the mesiobuccal canal, which was suggestive of strip perforation. The mesiobuccal and mesiolingual canals were located with no. 15 K file []. All the canals were cleaned and shaped with rotary ProTapers using the crown down approach, and the master cones were selected. Next, calcium hydroxide was packed in the canal, and access was sealed with intermediate restorative material (IRM). After 1 week, the canals were irrigated with 3% NaOCl and then dried with paper points. The mesiobuccal canal was obturated with ProTaper GP till the strip perforation site. Gray MTA-Angelus was applied in a manner similar to that described for case 1. There was slight extrusion of the material into the site []. The mesiolingual canal and distal canal were then obturated with GP and AH-plus sealer. Then, the access was sealed with IRM. On follow up after 4 weeks, the sinus tract had completely healed and the access was filled with composite. On follow up after 6 months, radiographic evidence of bone formation adjacent to the MTA and reduced probing depth (3 mm) was obtained []. 2-year follow up showed complete osseous healing at the apex and furcation [].",
